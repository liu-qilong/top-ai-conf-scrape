But simple prompting strategies often fail to elicit an LLM’s full capabilities. One way to elicit capabilities more robustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices to elicit capabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs fine-tuned such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. Specifically, these LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present in the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise. Password-locked models enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities elicitation methods, by testing whether these password-locked capabilities can be elicited without using the password. We find that a few high-quality demonstrations are often sufficient to fully elicit password-locked capabilities. More surprisingly, fine-tuning can elicit other capabilities that have been locked using the same password, or even different passwords. Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations, are available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective method of eliciting hidden capabilities of current models but may be unreliable when high-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g., as may be the case when models’ (hidden) capabilities exceed those of human demonstrators.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'safety_in_machine_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/060fc5a68cf9e8cd99067fa71d86b9b2407c68af.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/da6619534d79b7246746540de2464bd411225e1e.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\ngreenblatt2024stresstesting,\\ntitle={Stress-Testing Capability Elicitation With Password-Locked Models},\\nauthor={Ryan Greenblatt and Fabien Roger and Dmitrii Krasheninnikov and David Krueger},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=zzOOqD6R1b}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'greenblatt|stresstesting_capability_elicitation_with_passwordlocked_models'}},forum = 'zzOOqD6R1b',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6188/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6188/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6188/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6188/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

To facilitate cross-hardware learning, previous efforts attempt to directly collect multi-hardware data and perform centralized training, which is impractical due to severe user data privacy concerns and hardware heterogeneity across different platforms/institutions. In this study, we explicitly consider data privacy and heterogeneity in cooperatively optimizing SCI systems by proposing a Federated Hardware-Prompt learning (FedHP) framework. Rather than mitigating the client drift by rectifying the gradients, which only takes effect on the learning manifold but fails to solve the heterogeneity rooted in the input data space, FedHP learns a hardware-conditioned prompter to align inconsistent data distribution across clients, serving as an indicator of the data inconsistency among different hardware (e.g., coded apertures). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FedHP coordinates the pre-trained model to multiple hardware con- figurations, outperforming prevalent FL frameworks for 0.35dB under challenging heterogeneous settings.

The main challenge here lies in the lack of ground truth information about real anomaly nodes. To address this challenge, GGAD is designed to leverage two important priors about the anomaly nodes -- asymmetric local affinity and egocentric closeness -- to generate reliable outlier nodes that assimilate anomaly nodes in both graph structure and feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world GAD datasets are performed to establish a benchmark for semi-supervised GAD and show that GGAD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised GAD methods with varying numbers of training normal nodes.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'graph_neural_networks'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/3c33b4f4c3c23708a8d12f3c6cbda3a20a9ca71e.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/909949c36e711c24253839184c0f149002910c81.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nqiao2024generative,\\ntitle={Generative Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection},\\nauthor={Hezhe Qiao and Qingsong Wen and Xiaoli Li and Ee-Peng Lim and Guansong Pang},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=zqLAMwVLkt}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'qiao|generative_semisupervised_graph_anomaly_detection'}},forum = 'zqLAMwVLkt',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10275/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10275/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10275/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10275/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly, we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play neural network layer called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve representation learning in time-series models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to achieve different levels of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\\\\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline.

Consequently, while these methods perform effectively under such conditions, they generally fail when input image pairs come from different domains, referred to as multimodal image pairs.\\nTo address these limitations, we propose AltO, an unsupervised learning framework for estimating homography in multimodal image pairs.

As a result, we demonstrate that our method, AltO, can be trained on multimodal datasets without any ground-truth data.

Based on CLIP, recent methods design various learnable prompts to evaluate the zero-shot generalization capability on a base-to-novel setting. This setting assumes test samples are already divided into either base or novel classes, limiting its application to realistic scenarios. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging and practical setting: generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), i.e., testing with no information about the base/novel division. To address this challenging zero-shot problem, we introduce two unique designs that enable us to classify an image without the need of knowing whether it comes from seen or unseen classes. Firstly, most existing methods only adopt a single latent space to align visual and linguistic features, which has a limited ability to represent complex visual-linguistic patterns, especially for fine-grained tasks. Instead, we propose a dual-space feature alignment module that effectively augments the latent space with a novel attribute space induced by a well-devised attribute reservoir. In particular, the attribute reservoir consists of a static vocabulary and learnable tokens complementing each other for flexible control over feature granularity. Secondly, finetuning CLIP models (e.g., prompt learning) on seen base classes usually sacrifices the model's original generalization capability on unseen novel classes. To mitigate this issue, we present a new topology-preserving objective that can enforce feature topology structures of the combined base and novel classes to resemble the topology of CLIP.

Towards this goal, the conventional linear weighting method, which aggregates multiple rewards into a single surrogate reward through weighted summation, can only achieve sub-optimal policies when multiple rewards are related. Motivated by this, we propose a novel decomposition-based policy learning (DPPL) method that converts the whole problem into subproblems. The DPPL method is capable of obtaining optimal policies even when multiple rewards are interrelated. Nevertheless, the DPPL method requires a set of preference vectors specified in advance, posing challenges in practical applications where selecting suitable preferences is non-trivial. To mitigate this, we further theoretically transform the optimization problem in DPPL into an $\\\\varepsilon$-constraint problem, where $\\\\varepsilon$ represents the minimum acceptable levels of other rewards while maximizing one reward. This transformation provides intuitive into the selection of preference vectors.

GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve geometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge derived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric states. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target geometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition kernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB framework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more detailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way.

However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain’s dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination.\\nAs assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts.

The objective of this paper is to address the persistent bottleneck challenges from three perspectives: model, dataset, and benchmark.  1) Model-level: we propose a Pixel-level IEA Network (P-IEANet) that utilizes Haar discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to analyze, decompose, and assess exposure from both lightness and structural perspectives, capable of generating pixel-level assessment results under no-reference scenarios. 2) Dataset-level: we elaborately build an exposure-oriented dataset, IEA40K, containing 40K  images, covering 17 typical lighting scenarios, 27 devices, and 50+ scenes, with each image densely annotated by more than 10 experts with pixel-level labels.  3) Benchmark-level: we develop a comprehensive benchmark of 19 methods based on IEA40K. Our P-IEANet not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics but also seamlessly integrates with existing exposure correction and lighting enhancement methods.

In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, called Neural Gaffer, that takes a single image of any object and can synthesize an accurate, high-quality relit image under any novel environmental lighting condition, simply by conditioning an image generator on a target environment map, without an explicit scene decomposition. Our method builds on a pre-trained diffusion model, and fine-tunes it on a synthetic relighting dataset, revealing and harnessing the inherent understanding of lighting present in the diffusion model.

To fill this blank, we begin by examining the intermediate statuses during the gradual denoising generation process in DPM. The empirical observations indicate, the shape of image is reconstructed after the first few denoising steps, and then the image is filled with details (e.g., texture). The phenomenon is because the low-frequency signal (shape relevant) of the noisy image is not corrupted until the final stage in the forward process (initial stage of generation) of adding noise in DPM. Inspired by the observations, we proceed to explore the influence of each token in the text prompt during the two stages. After a series of experiments of T2I generations conditioned on a set of text prompts. We conclude that in the earlier generation stage, the image is mostly decided by the special token [\\\\texttt{EOS}] in the text prompt, and the information in the text prompt is already conveyed in this stage.

In this work, we propose a simple but effective framework (called ResAD) that can be directly applied to detect anomalies in new classes. Our main insight is to learn the residual feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. In this way, we can significantly reduce feature variations. Even in new classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably shift from the learned distribution. Therefore, the learned model can be directly adapted to new classes. ResAD consists of three components: (1) a Feature Converter that converts initial features into residual features; (2) a simple and shallow Feature Constraintor that constrains normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for further reducing feature variations and maintaining consistency in feature scales among different classes; (3) a Feature Distribution Estimator that estimates the normal residual feature distribution, anomalies can be recognized as out-of-distribution.

Concretely, Scala activates several subnets during training, introduces Isolated Activation to disentangle the smallest sub-network from other subnets, and leverages Scale Coordination to ensure each sub-network receives simplified, steady, and accurate learning objectives. Comprehensive empirical validations on different tasks demonstrate that with only one-shot training, Scala learns slimmable representation without modifying the original ViT structure and matches the performance of Separate Training.

To combine the strengths of both approaches, we adopt a hybrid method that fine-tunes cutting-edge diffusion models by optimizing reward models through RL. Although prior work has explored similar avenues, they primarily focus on scenarios where accurate reward models are accessible. In contrast, we concentrate on an offline setting where a reward model is unknown, and we must learn from static offline datasets, a common scenario in scientific domains. In offline scenarios, existing approaches tend to suffer from overoptimization, as they may be misled by the reward model in out-of-distribution regions. To address this, we introduce a conservative fine-tuning approach, BRAID, by optimizing a conservative reward model, which includes additional penalization outside of offline data distributions. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to outperform the best designs in offline data, leveraging the extrapolation capabilities of reward models while avoiding the generation of invalid designs through pre-trained diffusion models.'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/208379a521961503552a6647a7533a7037e81262.pdf'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'diffusion_based_models'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/285152ee7a6a7419534ed874d06583c7bb56f9f4.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nuehara2024bridging,\\ntitle={Bridging Model-Based Optimization and Generative Modeling via Conservative Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models},\\nauthor={Masatoshi Uehara and Yulai Zhao and Ehsan Hajiramezanali and Gabriele Scalia and G{\\\\\"o}kcen Eraslan and Avantika Lal and Sergey Levine and Tommaso Biancalani},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=zIr2QjU4hl}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'uehara|bridging_modelbased_optimization_and_generative_modeling_via_conservative_finetuning_of_diffusion_models'}},forum = 'zIr2QjU4hl',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12648/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12648/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12648/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12648/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Specifically, we first propose a Semantics-Layout Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) to jointly derive (layouts, semantics) from the input scene graph, which allows a more diverse and reasonable generation in a one-to-many mapping. We then develop a Compositional Masked Attention (CMA) integrated with a diffusion model, incorporating (layouts, semantics) with fine-grained attributes as generation guidance.

Furthermore, this loss function fails to account for label correlations. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel surrogate loss, *multi-label logistic loss*,  that accounts for label correlations and benefits from label-independent $H$-consistency bounds. We then broaden our analysis to cover a more extensive family of multi-label losses, including all common ones and a new extension defined based on linear-fractional functions with respect to the confusion matrix. We also extend our multi-label logistic losses to more comprehensive multi-label comp-sum losses, adapting comp-sum losses from standard classification to the multi-label learning. We prove that this family of surrogate losses benefits from $H$-consistency bounds, and thus Bayes-consistency, across any general multi-label loss. Our work thus proposes a unified surrogate loss framework benefiting from strong consistency guarantees for any multi-label loss, significantly expanding upon previous work which only established Bayes-consistency and for specific loss functions. Additionally, we adapt constrained losses from standard classification to multi-label constrained losses in a similar way, which also benefit from $H$-consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency for any multi-label loss.

To tackle this, we introduce a novel paradigm of clip-level vectorized HD map construction, MapUnveiler, which explicitly unveils the occluded map elements within a clip input by relating dense image representations with efficient clip tokens. Additionally, MapUnveiler associates inter-clip information through clip token propagation, effectively utilizing long- term temporal map information. MapUnveiler runs efficiently with the proposed clip-level pipeline by avoiding redundant computation with temporal stride while building a global map relationship. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MapUnveiler achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmark datasets. We also showcase that MapUnveiler significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in a challenging setting, achieving +10.7% mAP improvement in heavily occluded driving road scenes.

To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, XMask3D. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

This paper resorts to the linear interpolation strategy and proposes to reduce the complexity of gradient estimation by reusing queries in the prior iterations while maintaining the sample size unchanged. Specifically, we model the gradient estimation as a quadratically constrained linear program problem and manage to derive the analytical solution.

Moreover, part of the intermediate variables that contribute to the gradient estimation can be directly indexed, significantly reducing the computation complexity.

In this work, we approach this question for the first time by comparing the inductive bias of gradient descent (GD) with that of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM). By studying a two-layer CNN, we rigorously prove that SAM learns different features more uniformly, particularly in early epochs. That is, SAM is less susceptible to simplicity bias compared to GD. We also show that examples constraining features that are learned early are separable from the rest based on the model’s output.

Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping), and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a *minimalist* RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the *relative reward* between two completions to a prompt in terms of the policy, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and be extended to handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally efficient than PPO. When fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct, REBEL achieves strong performance in AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard.

We demonstrate that such an approach enables the experience of immersive virtual tourism - performing a real-time dynamic navigation within the scene, experiencing both audio and visual content. Current audio-visual rendering approaches typically rely on visual cues, such as images, and thus visual artifacts could cause inconsistency in the audio quality. Furthermore, when such approaches are incorporated with visual rendering, audio generation at each viewpoint occurs after the rendering of the image of the viewpoint and thus could lead to audio lag that affects the integration of audio and visual streams. Our proposed approach, AV-Cloud, overcomes these challenges by learning the representation of the audio-visual scene based on a set of sparse AV anchor points, that constitute the Audio-Visual Cloud, and are derived from the camera calibration. The Audio-Visual Cloud serves as an audio-visual representation from which the generation of spatial audio for arbitrary listener location can be generated. In particular, we propose a novel module Audio-Visual Cloud Splatting which decodes AV anchor points into a spatial audio transfer function for the arbitrary viewpoint of the target listener. This function, applied through the Spatial Audio Render Head module, transforms monaural input into viewpoint-specific spatial audio. As a result, AV-Cloud efficiently renders the spatial audio aligned with any visual viewpoint and eliminates the need for pre-rendered images. We show that AV-Cloud surpasses current state-of-the-art accuracy on audio reconstruction, perceptive quality, and acoustic effects on two real-world datasets.

In such dynamic environments, employing pre-trained models may be inefficient, as they struggle to adapt to the constantly evolving data streams. To address this challenge, clients can fine-tune models online, leveraging their observed data to enhance performance. Despite the potential benefits of client participation in federated online model fine-tuning, existing analyses have not conclusively demonstrated its superiority over local model fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, the present paper develops a novel personalized federated learning algorithm, wherein each client constructs a personalized model by combining a locally fine-tuned model with multiple federated models learned by the server over time.

This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we (1) Characterize the game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; and (2) Perform LLM-vs.-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Most open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and Llama-2-70b-chat, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games, yet the recently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct makes up for this shortcoming. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. We further characterize the game-theoretic properties of LLMs, such as equilibrium and Pareto Efficiency in repeated games. Detailed error profiles are provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior.

This reduces the information propagation path to $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$, effectively addressing the limitations of RNN. To enhance PGN's performance in long-range time series forecasting tasks, we propose a novel temporal modeling framework called Temporal PGN (TPGN).

Starting with a pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a novel appearance that matches the given style.

In this work, we propose ReGS, which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce state-of-the-art stylization results that respect the reference texture while embracing real-time rendering speed for free-view navigation.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'TLDR': {'value': 'We present a method to enable precise appearance editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting.'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/ff2c2a64aeb6fea451908d363d55da1992fca363.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/03d46a6680a888891cb3451bb08578c96fbcc074.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nmei2024regs,\\ntitle={Re{GS}: Reference-based Controllable Scene Stylization with Gaussian Splatting},\\nauthor={Yiqun Mei and Jiacong Xu and Vishal M.

Earlier research highlighted DMs' vulnerability to data poisoning attacks, but these studies placed stricter requirements than conventional methods like 'BadNets' in image classification. This is because the art necessitates modifications to the diffusion training and sampling procedures. Unlike the prior work, we investigate whether BadNets-like data poisoning methods can directly degrade the generation by DMs. In other words, if only the training dataset is contaminated (without manipulating the diffusion process), how will this affect the performance of learned DMs? In this setting, we uncover bilateral data poisoning effects that not only serve an adversarial purpose (compromising the functionality of DMs) but also offer a defensive advantage (which can be leveraged for defense in classification tasks against poisoning attacks). We show that a BadNets-like data poisoning attack remains effective in DMs for producing incorrect images (misaligned with the intended text conditions). Meanwhile, poisoned DMs exhibit an increased ratio of triggers, a phenomenon we refer to as 'trigger amplification', among the generated images. This insight can be then used to enhance the detection of poisoned training data. In addition, even under a low poisoning ratio, studying the poisoning effects of DMs is also valuable for designing robust image classifiers against such attacks. Last but not least, we establish a meaningful linkage between data poisoning and the phenomenon of data replications by exploring DMs' inherent data memorization tendencies.

In many real-world scenarios, rather than solely predicting an outcome using an ML model, the crucial concern is how to make decisions to prevent the occurrence of undesired outcomes, known as the *avoiding undesired future (AUF)* problem. To this end, a new framework called *rehearsal learning* has been proposed recently, which works effectively in stationary environments by leveraging the influence relations among variables. In real tasks, however, the environments are usually non-stationary, where the influence relations may be *dynamic*, leading to the failure of AUF by the existing method. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential methodology that effectively updates the estimates of dynamic influence relations, which are crucial for rehearsal learning to prevent undesired outcomes in non-stationary environments. Meanwhile, we take the cost of decision actions into account and provide the formulation of AUF problem with minimal action cost under non-stationarity. We prove that in linear Gaussian cases, the problem can be transformed into the well-studied convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). In this way, we establish the first polynomial-time rehearsal-based approach for addressing the AUF problem.

In addition, forcing models to match the dynamics of observed garment animation may hinder the potentials to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, instead of using garment-wise supervised-learning we adopt a disentangled scheme to learn how to animate observed garments: 1). learning constitutive behaviors from the observed cloth; 2). dynamically animate various garments constrained by the learned constitutive laws. Specifically, we propose Energy Unit network (EUNet) to model the constitutive relations in the format of energy. Without the priors from analytical physics models and differentiable simulation engines, EUNet is able to directly capture the constitutive behaviors from the observed piece of cloth and uniformly describes the change of energy caused by deformations, such as stretching and bending. We further apply the pre-trained EUNet to animate various garments based on energy optimizations.

Following this, accurate sparse reconstructions are necessary for further dense modeling, which is then input into task-specific neural networks.

Built on a general Transformer-based framework, LSM predicts global geometry via pixel-aligned point maps. To improve spatial attribute regression, we adopt local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, enhancing the accuracy of fine local details. To address the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field.

In this paper, we introduce a novel binarized diffusion model, BI-DiffSR, for image SR. First, for the model structure, we design a UNet architecture optimized for binarization. We propose the consistent-pixel-downsample (CP-Down) and consistent-pixel-upsample (CP-Up) to maintain dimension consistent and facilitate the full-precision information transfer. Meanwhile, we design the channel-shuffle-fusion (CS-Fusion) to enhance feature fusion in skip connection. Second, for the activation difference across timestep, we design the timestep-aware redistribution (TaR) and activation function (TaA). The TaR and TaA dynamically adjust the distribution of activations based on different timesteps, improving the flexibility and representation alability of the binarized module. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BI-DiffSR outperforms existing binarization methods.

Despite its role in exploring and learning, the function and neural basis of this variability is still not well understood. Given the coupling between neural activity and behavior, we ask what type of neural variability does not compromise behavioral performance. While previous studies typically curtail variability to allow for high task performance in neural networks, our approach takes the reversed perspective. We investigate how to generate maximal neural variability while at the same time having high network performance. \\nTo do so, we extend to neural activity the maximum occupancy principle (MOP) developed for behavior, and refer to this new neural principle as NeuroMOP. NeuroMOP posits that the goal of the nervous system is to maximize future action-state entropy, a reward-free, intrinsic motivation that entails creating all possible activity patterns while avoiding terminal or dangerous ones.\\nWe show that this goal can be achieved through a neural network controller that injects currents (actions) into a recurrent neural network of fixed random weights to maximize future cumulative action-state entropy. \\nHigh activity variability can be induced while adhering to an energy constraint or while avoiding terminal states defined by specific neurons' activities, also in a context-dependent manner. The network solves these tasks by flexibly switching between stochastic and deterministic modes as needed and projecting noise onto a null space. Based on future maximum entropy production, NeuroMOP contributes to a novel theory of neural variability that reconciles stochastic and deterministic behaviors within a single framework.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'neuroscience_and_cognitive_science'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/bd4ce492257f560caead52dd6d5cf618cf2665fb.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/8f8c00e81f8a6216c0d6ac14a152a196d05ae8ee.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': \"@inproceedings{\\nmastrogiuseppe2024controlled,\\ntitle={Controlled maximal variability along with reliable performance in recurrent neural networks},\\nauthor={Chiara Mastrogiuseppe and Rub{\\\\'e}n Moreno-Bote},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=yXW2dCTQdi}\\n}\"}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'mastrogiuseppe|controlled_maximal_variability_along_with_reliable_performance_in_recurrent_neural_networks'}},forum = 'yXW2dCTQdi',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11170/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11170/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11170/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11170/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0'),\n",

Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding.

Focusing learning on these relevant actions can significantly improve training efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose to focus learning on the set of relevant actions and introduce three continuous action masking methods for exactly mapping the action space to the state-dependent set of relevant actions.

Video Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation (ATM) aims to restore videos affected by these distortions. However, existing video ATM methods, both supervised and self-supervised, struggle to maintain temporally consistent mitigation across frames, leading to visually incoherent results. This limitation arises from the stochastic nature of atmospheric turbulence, which varies across space and time. Inspired by the observation that atmospheric turbulence induces high-frequency temporal variations, we propose ConVRT, a novel framework for consistent video restoration through turbulence. ConVRT introduces a neural video representation that explicitly decouples spatial and temporal information into a spatial content field and a temporal deformation field, enabling targeted regularization of the network's temporal representation capability. By leveraging the low-pass filtering properties of the regularized temporal representations, ConVRT effectively mitigates turbulence-induced temporal frequency variations and promotes temporal consistency. Furthermore, our training framework seamlessly integrates supervised pre-training on synthetic turbulence data with self-supervised learning on real-world videos, significantly improving the temporally consistent mitigation of ATM methods on diverse real-world data.

However, fine-tuning LLMs for alignment often suffers from unstable training and requires substantial computing resources. Test-time alignment techniques, such as prompting and guided decoding, do not modify the underlying model, and their performance remains dependent on the original model's capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose aligning LLMs through representation editing. The core of our method is to view a pre-trained autoregressive LLM as a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system. To achieve alignment for specific objectives, we introduce external control signals into the state space of this language dynamical system. We train a value function directly on the hidden states according to the Bellman equation, enabling gradient-based optimization to obtain the optimal control signals at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing test-time alignment techniques while requiring significantly fewer resources compared to fine-tuning methods.

To address this issue, we propose to embed $SE(3)$ equivariance into the Perceiver IO architecture. We employ Spherical Harmonics for positional encoding to ensure 3D rotation equivariance, and develop a specialized equivariant encoder and decoder within the Perceiver IO architecture.

To estimate how close an agent is to achieving its goal, our method uniquely incorporates a $Q$-function and a trainable reward function based on Adversarial Intrinsic Motivation within the diffusion model. Furthermore, it promotes exploration through the inherent noising and denoising mechanism present in the diffusion models and is environment-agnostic. This combination allows for the generation of challenging yet achievable goals, enabling agents to learn effectively without relying on domain knowledge.

We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show preliminary results on scaling to protein monomers.

In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the effect of instructions on object hallucinations in LVLMs, with a specific focus on the role played by image description lengths. A valuable finding is that instructions indirectly affect hallucinations through the length of image descriptions. The longer the image description, the higher the object hallucination degree. Accordingly, we fit an informative length-hallucination curve, upon which a fine-grained evaluation framework named LeHaCE is introduced for evaluating object hallucinations at any given image description length. LeHaCE evaluates the object hallucination degree at a uniform image description length to mitigate the effect of description lengths, promoting stability and fairness. Moreover, LeHaCE incorporates the curve slope as an innovative hallucination evaluation metric, reflecting the extent to which the object hallucination degree is affected by the image description length, achieving a more comprehensive evaluation.

This shift often occurs in imbalanced classification since positive data are often more diverse and time-varying than negative data. To deal with this shift, we theoretically show that the AUC on the test distribution can be expressed by using the positive and marginal training densities and the marginal test density. Based on this result, we can maximize the AUC on the test distribution by using positive and unlabeled data in the training distribution and unlabeled data in the test distribution. The proposed method requires only positive labels in the training distribution as supervision. Moreover, the derived AUC has a simple form and thus is easy to implement. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown with four real-world datasets.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'other'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/6babeb80637c127be43e9a61c520ffe601db0123.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nkumagai2024auc,\\ntitle={{AUC} Maximization under Positive Distribution Shift},\\nauthor={Atsutoshi Kumagai and Tomoharu Iwata and Hiroshi Takahashi and Taishi Nishiyama and Yasuhiro Fujiwara},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=yOe6ajdslI}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'kumagai|auc_maximization_under_positive_distribution_shift'}},forum = 'yOe6ajdslI',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8293/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8293/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8293/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8293/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel interactive multi-modal image fusion framework based on the text-modulated diffusion model, called Text-DiFuse. First, this framework integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion process, allowing adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal information fusion. This is the first attempt to deeply and explicitly embed information fusion within the diffusion process, effectively addressing compound degradation in image fusion. Second, by embedding the combination of the text and zero-shot location model into the diffusion fusion process, a text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy is developed. This enables user-customized text control to improve fusion performance and highlight foreground objects in the fused images. Extensive experiments on diverse public datasets show that our Text-DiFuse achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance across various scenarios with complex degradation.

A common belief is that modeling the correlations between objects is beneficial for multi-label recognition. However, this belief has been recently challenged as label correlations may mislead the classifier in testing, due to the possible contextual bias in training. Accordingly, a few of recent works not only discarded label correlation modeling, but also advocated to remove contextual information for multi-label image recognition. This work explicitly explores label correlations for multi-label image recognition based on a principled causal intervention approach. With causal intervention, we pursue causal label correlations and suppress spurious label correlations, as the former tend to convey useful contextual cues while the later may mislead the classifier. Specifically, we decouple label-specific features with a Transformer decoder attached to the backbone network, and model the confounders which may give rise to spurious correlations by clustering spatial features of all training images. Based on label-specific features and confounders, we employ a cross-attention module to implement causal intervention, quantifying the causal correlations from all object categories to each predicted object category. Finally, we obtain image labels by combining the predictions from decoupled features and causal label correlations.

To address this challenge, we propose POETRY (PrOvE Theorems RecursivelY), which proves theorems in a recursive, level-by-level manner in the Isabelle theorem prover. Unlike previous step-by-step methods, POETRY searches for a verifiable sketch of the proof at each level and focuses on solving the current level's theorem or conjecture. Detailed proofs of intermediate conjectures within the sketch are temporarily replaced by a placeholder tactic called sorry, deferring their proofs to subsequent levels. This approach allows the theorem to be tackled incrementally by outlining the overall theorem at the first level and then solving the intermediate conjectures at deeper levels. Experiments are conducted on the miniF2F and PISA datasets and significant performance gains are observed in our POETRY approach over state-of-the-art methods. POETRY on miniF2F achieves an average proving success rate improvement of 5.1%.

To address the above problems, we introduce LeapAD, a novel paradigm for autonomous driving inspired by the human cognitive process. Specifically, LeapAD emulates human attention by selecting critical objects relevant to driving decisions, simplifying environmental interpretation, and mitigating decision-making complexities. Additionally, LeapAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module, which consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) for thorough analysis and reasoning, along with a Heuristic Process (System-I) for swift and empirical processing. The Analytic Process leverages its logical reasoning to accumulate linguistic driving experience, which is then transferred to the Heuristic Process by supervised fine-tuning. Through reflection mechanisms and a growing memory bank, LeapAD continuously improves itself from past mistakes in a closed-loop environment. Closed-loop testing in CARLA shows that LeapAD outperforms all methods relying solely on camera input, requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less labeled data. Experiments also demonstrate that as the memory bank expands, the Heuristic Process with only 1.8B parameters can inherit the knowledge from a GPT-4 powered Analytic Process and achieve continuous performance improvement.

SMoE has the potential to exponentially increase in parameter count while maintaining the efficiency of the model by only activating a small subset of these parameters for a given sample. However, it has been observed that SMoE suffers from unstable training and has difficulty adapting to new distributions, leading to the model's lack of robustness to data contamination. To overcome these limitations, we first establish a connection between the dynamics of the expert representations in SMoEs and gradient descent on a multi-objective optimization problem. Leveraging our framework, we then integrate momentum into SMoE and propose a new family of SMoEs, named MomentumSMoE. We theoretically prove and numerically validate that MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE.

With the rapid advancements in cross-modality synthesis and brain decoding, the use of deep neural networks has emerged as a promising solution for inferring whole-brain, high-resolution fMRI features directly from electroencephalography (EEG), a more widely accessible and portable neuroimaging modality. Nonetheless, the complex projection from neural activity to fMRI hemodynamic responses and the spatial ambiguity of EEG pose substantial challenges both in modeling and interpretability. Relatively few studies to date have developed approaches for EEG-fMRI translation, and although they have made significant strides, the inference of fMRI signals in a given study has been limited to a small set of brain areas and to a single condition (i.e., either resting-state or a specific task). The capability to predict fMRI signals in other brain areas, as well as to generalize across conditions, remain critical gaps in the field. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel and generalizable framework: NeuroBOLT, i.e., Neuro-to-BOLD Transformer, which leverages multi-dimensional representation learning from temporal, spatial, and spectral domains to translate raw EEG data to the corresponding fMRI activity signals across the brain. Our experiments demonstrate that NeuroBOLT effectively reconstructs unseen resting-state fMRI signals from primary sensory, high-level cognitive areas, and deep subcortical brain regions, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with the potential to generalize across varying conditions and sites, which significantly advances the integration of these two modalities.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'neuroscience_and_cognitive_science'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/7637d729304c503ef5c555a139062365ae9005dc.pdf'}, 'flagged_for_ethics_review': {'value': True}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nli2024neurobolt,\\ntitle={Neuro{BOLT}: Resting-state {EEG}-to-f{MRI} Synthesis with Multi-dimensional Feature Mapping},\\nauthor={Yamin Li and Ange Lou and Ziyuan Xu and SHENGCHAO ZHANG and Shiyu Wang and Dario J.

Despite its potential, standard FL algorithms lack support for diverse heterogeneous device prototypes, which vary significantly in model and dataset sizes---from small IoT devices to large workstations. This limitation is only partially addressed by existing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge effectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied capabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of informative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones, and the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all devices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique contributions of each device. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel KD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device prototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to preserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a KD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the noisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process. To integrate the separately distilled knowledge, we introduce an adaptive task arithmetic knowledge integration process, allowing each student model to customize the knowledge integration for optimal performance. Additionally, we present theoretical results demonstrating the effectiveness of task arithmetic in transferring knowledge across heterogeneous device prototypes with varying capacities. Comprehensive evaluations of our method across both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks demonstrate that TAKFL achieves state-of-the-art results in a variety of datasets and settings, significantly outperforming existing KD-based methods.

Thus, in HEPrune, we further propose ciphertext-wise pruning to reduce ciphertext computation numbers without hurting accuracy.

In this work, we introduce a new robust camera-insensitivity problem: how to overcome the issues caused by the failed camera perspectives, while stabilizing high collaborative performance with low calibration cost? To address above problems, we propose RCDN, a Robust Camera-insensitivity collaborative perception with a novel Dynamic feature-based 3D Neural modeling mechanism. The key intuition of RCDN is to construct collaborative neural rendering field representations to recover failed perceptual messages sent by multiple agents. To better model collaborative neural rendering field, RCDN first establishes a geometry BEV feature based time-invariant static field with other agents via fast hash grid modeling. Based on the static background field, the proposed time-varying dynamic field can model corresponding motion vector for foregrounds with appropriate positions. To validate RCDN, we create OPV2V-N, a new large-scale dataset with manual labelling under different camera failed scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on OPV2V-N show that RCDN can be ported to other baselines and improve their robustness in extreme camera-insensitivity setting.

However, the transfer suffers when the teacher model is significantly larger than the student. To overcome this, prior works have proposed training intermediately sized models, Teacher Assistants (TAs) to help the transfer process. However, training TAs is expensive, as training these models is a knowledge transfer task in itself. Further, these TAs are larger than the student model and training them especially in large data settings can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Controlled Information Flow for Knowledge Distillation (CIFD) consisting of two components. First, we propose a significantly smaller alternatives to TAs, the Rate-Distortion Module (RDM) which uses the teacher's penultimate layer embedding and a information rate-constrained bottleneck layer to replace the Teacher Assistant model. RDMs are smaller and easier to train than TAs, especially in large data regimes, since they operate on the teacher embeddings and do not need to relearn low level input feature extractors. Also, by varying the information rate across the bottleneck, RDMs can replace TAs of different sizes. Secondly, we propose the use of Information Bottleneck Module in the student model, which is crucial for regularization in the presence of a large number of RDMs. We show comprehensive state-of-the-art results of the proposed method over large datasets like Imagenet. Further, we show the significant improvement in distilling CLIP like models over a huge 12M image-text dataset. It outperforms CLIP specialized distillation methods across five zero-shot classification datasets and two zero-shot image-text retrieval datasets.\"}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/bf757aa0647765798d48b492071c603b7edc57aa.pdf'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nsaidutta2024cifd,\\ntitle={{CIFD}: Controlled Information Flow to Enhance Knowledge Distillation},\\nauthor={Yashas Malur Saidutta and Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa and Jaejin Cho and Ching-Hua Lee and Chouchang Yang and Yilin Shen and Hongxia Jin},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=xutrKezbPF}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'saidutta|cifd_controlled_information_flow_to_enhance_knowledge_distillation'}},forum = 'xutrKezbPF',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11922/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11922/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11922/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission11922/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

We introduce the Biomechanical Pose Generator (BPG), which leverages biomechanical principles, specifically the normal range of motion, to autonomously generate a wide array of plausible 3D poses without relying on a source dataset, thus overcoming the restrictions of popularity bias. To address depth ambiguity, we propose the Binary Depth Coordinates (BDC), which simplifies depth estimation into a binary classification of joint positions (front or back). This method decomposes a 3D pose into three core elements—2D pose, bone length, and binary depth decision—substantially reducing depth ambiguity and enhancing model robustness and accuracy, particularly in complex poses. Our results demonstrate that these approaches increase the diversity and volume of pose data while consistently achieving performance gains, even amid the complexities introduced by increased pose diversity.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/f77e33cf32c4c31dd7e4130f762aac8101938e30.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/ffd6aa33f07118e67868116ac943421300451ddf.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nkim2024toward,\\ntitle={Toward Approaches to Scalability in 3D Human Pose Estimation},\\nauthor={Jun-Hee Kim and Seong-Whan Lee},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=xse8QMGnyM}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'kim|toward_approaches_to_scalability_in_3d_human_pose_estimation'}},forum = 'xse8QMGnyM',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14753/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14753/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14753/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14753/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

This requires a clearer understanding of network's training process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel NN named the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) which has solid mathematical basis and presents superior training stability. AOPU truncates the gradient backpropagation at dual parameters, optimizes the trackable parameters updates, and enhances the robustness of training.

Using such fixed text classifiers not only struggles to model visual relations with high variance, but also falls short in adapting to distinct contexts. To plug these intrinsic shortcomings, we devise SDSGG, a scene-specific description based OVSGG framework where the weights of text classifiers are adaptively adjusted according to the visual content. In particular, to generate comprehensive and diverse descriptions oriented to the scene, an LLM is asked to play different roles (e.g., biologist and engineer) to analyze and discuss the descriptive features of a given scene from different views. Unlike previous efforts simply treating the generated descriptions as mutually equivalent text classifiers, SDSGG is equipped with an advanced renormalization mechanism to adjust the influence of each text classifier based on its relevance to the presented scene (this is what the term “specific” means). Furthermore, to capture the complicated interplay between subjects and objects, we propose a new lightweight module called mutual visual adapter.

However, in real-world systems, most users interact with only a handful of items, while the majority of items are seldom consumed. These two issues, known as the long-tail user and long-tail item challenges, often pose difficulties for existing SRS. These challenges can adversely affect user experience and seller benefits, making them crucial to address. Though a few works have addressed the challenges, they still struggle with the seesaw or noisy issues due to the intrinsic scarcity of interactions. The advancements in large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these problems from a semantic perspective. As one of the pioneers in this field, we propose the Large Language Models Enhancement framework for Sequential Recommendation (LLM-ESR). This framework utilizes semantic embeddings derived from LLMs to enhance SRS without adding extra inference load. To address the long-tail item challenge, we design a dual-view modeling framework that combines semantics from LLMs and collaborative signals from conventional SRS. For the long-tail user challenge, we propose a retrieval augmented self-distillation method to enhance user preference representation using more informative interactions from similar users. To verify the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed enhancement framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets using three popular SRS models. The results consistently show that our method surpasses existing baselines.

It utilizes binary spike activations to transmit information, thereby replacing multiplications with additions and resulting in high energy efficiency. However, training an SNN directly poses a challenge due to the undefined gradient of the firing spike process. Although prior works have employed various surrogate gradient training methods that use an alternative function to replace the firing process during back-propagation, these approaches ignore an intrinsic problem: gradient vanishing. To address this issue, we propose a shortcut back-propagation method in the paper, which advocates for transmitting the gradient directly from the loss to the shallow layers. This enables us to present the gradient to the shallow layers directly, thereby significantly mitigating the gradient vanishing problem. Additionally, this method does not introduce any burden during the inference phase.\\nTo strike a balance between final accuracy and ease of training, we also propose an evolutionary training framework and implement it by inducing a balance coefficient that dynamically changes with the training epoch, which further improves the network's performance.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective strategy to improve the performance of a smaller LLM (i.e., the student model) by transferring knowledge from a high-performing LLM (i.e., the teacher model). Prevailing techniques in LLM distillation typically use a black-box model API to generate high-quality pretrained and aligned datasets, or utilize white-box distillation by altering the loss function to better transfer knowledge from the teacher LLM. However, these methods ignore the knowledge differences between the student and teacher LLMs across domains. This results in excessive focus on domains with minimal performance gaps and insufficient attention to domains with large gaps, reducing overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM distillation framework called DDK, which dynamically adjusts the composition of the distillation dataset in a smooth manner according to the domain performance differences between the teacher and student models, making the distillation process more stable and effective. Extensive evaluations show that DDK significantly improves the performance of student models, outperforming both continuously pretrained baselines and existing knowledge distillation methods by a large margin.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'natural_language_processing'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/21bd9bcb8bb3c29f998b32ec6cc9d3892d669785.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nliu2024ddk,\\ntitle={{DDK}: Distilling Domain Knowledge for Efficient Large Language Models},\\nauthor={Jiaheng Liu and Chenchen Zhang and Jinyang Guo and Yuanxing Zhang and Haoran Que and Ken Deng and ZhiqiBai and Jie Liu and Ge Zhang and JiakaiWang and Yanan Wu and Congnan Liu and Jiamang Wang and Lin Qu and Wenbo Su and Bo Zheng},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=xgiurUq0ss}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'liu|ddk_distilling_domain_knowledge_for_efficient_large_language_models'}},forum = 'xgiurUq0ss',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7038/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7038/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7038/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7038/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models.

We take the first step to protect the ownership of FedGL models via backdoor-based watermarking. Existing techniques have challenges in achieving the goal: 1) they either cannot be directly applied or yield unsatisfactory performance; 2) they are vulnerable to watermark removal attacks; and 3) they lack of formal guarantees. To address all the challenges, we propose FedGMark, the first certified robust backdoor-based watermarking for FedGL. FedGMark leverages the unique graph structure and client information in FedGL to learn customized and diverse watermarks. It also designs a novel GL architecture that facilitates defending against both the empirical and theoretically worst-case watermark removal attacks.

While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named SocialGPT, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. SocialGPT introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles.

In this paper, we focus on a more realistic and challenging task: to unsupervisedly learn a fused graph from multiple graphs that preserve sufficient task-relevant information while removing task-irrelevant noise. Specifically, our proposed Information-aware Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Fusion framework (InfoMGF) uses graph structure refinement to eliminate irrelevant noise and simultaneously maximizes view-shared and view-unique task-relevant information, thereby tackling the frontier of non-redundant multiplex graph. Theoretical analyses further guarantee the effectiveness of InfoMGF. Comprehensive experiments against various baselines on different downstream tasks demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. Surprisingly, our unsupervised method even beats the sophisticated supervised approaches.

In this work, we show that the reason for this deficiency is that language models are biased to learn word co-occurrence statistics instead of true factual associations. We identify the differences between two forms of knowledge representation in language models: knowledge in the form of co-occurrence statistics is encoded in the middle layers of the transformer model and does not generalize well to reasoning scenarios beyond simple question answering, while true factual associations are encoded in the lower layers and can be freely utilized in various reasoning tasks. Based on these observations, we propose two strategies to improve the learning of factual associations in language models. We show that training on text with implicit rather than explicit factual associations can force the model to learn factual associations instead of co-occurrence statistics, significantly improving the generalization of newly learned knowledge. We also propose a simple training method to actively forget the learned co-occurrence statistics, which unblocks and enhances the learning of factual associations when training on plain narrative text.

We propose SelfCodeAlign, the first fully transparent and permissive pipeline for self-aligning code LLMs without extensive human annotations or distillation. SelfCodeAlign employs the same base model for inference throughout the data generation process. It first extracts diverse coding concepts from high-quality seed snippets to generate new tasks. It then samples multiple responses per task, pairs each with test cases, and validates them in a sandbox environment. Finally, passing examples are selected for instruction tuning. In our primary experiments, we use SelfCodeAlign with CodeQwen1.5-7B to generate a dataset of 74k instruction-response pairs. Finetuning on this dataset leads to a model that achieves a 67.1 pass@1 on HumanEval+, surpassing CodeLlama-70B-Instruct despite being ten times smaller. Across all benchmarks, this finetuned model consistently outperforms the original version trained with OctoPack, the previous state-of-the-art method for instruction tuning without human annotations or distillation. Additionally, we show that SelfCodeAlign is effective across LLMs of various sizes, from 3B to 33B, and that the base models can benefit more from alignment with their own data distribution. We further validate each component’s effectiveness in our pipeline, showing that SelfCodeAlign outperforms both direct distillation from GPT-4o and leading GPT-3.5-based distillation methods, such as OSS-Instruct and Evol-Instruct. SelfCodeAlign has also led to the creation of StarCoder2-Instruct, the first fully transparent, permissively licensed, and self-aligned code LLM that achieves state-of-the-art coding performance.

A model matching technique is then applied to select the optimal personalized model, serving as a teacher model to guide each client’s training process. We conducted extensive experiments across three datasets, examining both IID and non-IID settings.

We hypothesize that LLMs with LFPs accurately aligned to the fine-tuning feedback exhibit consistent activation patterns for outputs that would have received similar feedback during RLHF. To test this, we train probes to estimate the feedback signal implicit in the activations of a fine-tuned LLM. We then compare these estimates to the true feedback, measuring how accurate the LFPs are to the fine-tuning feedback. Our probes are trained on a condensed, sparse and interpretable representation of LLM activations, making it easier to correlate features of the input with our probe's predictions. We validate our probes by comparing the neural features they correlate with positive feedback inputs against the features GPT-4 describes and classifies as related to LFPs.

Additionally, most existing video editing methods primarily focus on altering visual content, with limited research dedicated to motion editing. In this paper, we present a novel attempt to Remake a Video (ReVideo) which stands out from existing methods by allowing precise video editing in specific areas through the specification of both content and motion. Content editing is facilitated by modifying the first frame, while the trajectory-based motion control offers an intuitive user interaction experience. ReVideo addresses a new task involving the coupling and training imbalance between content and motion control. To tackle this, we develop a three-stage training strategy that progressively decouples these two aspects from coarse to fine.

In this paper, inspired by the black-box reduction of Cutkosky and Orabona [2018], we employ a surrogate loss defined over simpler domains to develop universal OCO algorithms that only require $1$ projection. Embracing the framework of prediction with expert advice, we maintain a set of experts for each type of functions and aggregate their predictions via a meta-algorithm. The crux of our approach lies in a uniquely designed expert-loss for strongly convex functions, stemming from an innovative decomposition of the regret into the meta-regret and the expert-regret. Our analysis sheds new light on the surrogate loss, facilitating a rigorous examination of the discrepancy between the regret of the original loss and that of the surrogate loss, and carefully controlling meta-regret under the strong convexity condition. With only $1$ projection per round, we establish optimal regret bounds for general convex, exponentially concave, and strongly convex functions simultaneously.

We thus also carefully devise an implementable inexactness condition that retains convergence guarantees similar to the exact versions, and propose a companion efficient solver for the subproblems of both RAMDA and existing methods to make them practically feasible. We leverage the theory of manifold identification in variational analysis to show that, even in the presence of such inexactness, the iterates of RAMDA attain the ideal structure induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence. This structure is locally optimal near the point of convergence, so RAMDA is guaranteed to obtain the best structure possible among all methods converging to the same point, making it the first regularized adaptive method outputting models that possess outstanding predictive performance while being (locally) optimally structured. Extensive numerical experiments in large-scale modern computer vision, language modeling, and speech tasks show that the proposed RAMDA is efficient and consistently outperforms state of the art for training structured neural network.

However, their iterative sampling process requiring denoising across multiple noise levels incurs substantial overhead. We propose to learn direct mappings from different noise levels to the optimal solution for a given instance, facilitating high-quality generation with minimal shots. This is achieved through an optimization consistency training protocol, which, for a given instance, minimizes the difference among samples originating from varying generative trajectories and time steps relative to the optimal solution. The proposed model enables fast single-step solution generation while retaining the option of multi-step sampling to trade for sampling quality, which offers a more effective and efficient alternative backbone for neural solvers. In addition, within the training-to-testing (T2T) framework, to bridge the gap between training on historical instances and solving new instances, we introduce a novel consistency-based gradient search scheme during the test stage, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space learned during training. It is achieved by updating the latent solution probabilities under objective gradient guidance during the alternation of noise injection and denoising steps. We refer to this model as Fast T2T. Extensive experiments on two popular tasks, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS), demonstrate the superiority of Fast T2T regarding both solution quality and efficiency, even outperforming LKH given limited time budgets.

While existing ICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g., x-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on unstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks like word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models trained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements and training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities can\\nemerge simply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured data; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through co-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms. However, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks requiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where ICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new, unseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs appear only in fixed training positions.

However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks. **Videos are available at https://meshformer3d.github.io/**\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 oral'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/0137993914b1c34b105ba8ce5545d99389e3b12a.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nliu2024meshformer,\\ntitle={MeshFormer : High-Quality Mesh Generation with 3D-Guided Reconstruction Model},\\nauthor={Minghua Liu and Chong Zeng and Xinyue Wei and Ruoxi Shi and Linghao Chen and Chao Xu and Mengqi Zhang and Zhaoning Wang and Xiaoshuai Zhang and Isabella Liu and Hongzhi Wu and Hao Su},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=x7pjdDod6Z}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'liu|meshformer_highquality_mesh_generation_with_3dguided_reconstruction_model'}},forum = 'x7pjdDod6Z',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2381/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

We introduce PARD, a Permutation-invariant Auto Regressive Diffusion model that integrates diffusion models with autoregressive methods. PARD harnesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the autoregressive model while maintaining permutation invariance without ordering sensitivity. Specifically, we show that contrary to sets, elements in a graph are not entirely un-ordered and there is a unique partial order for nodes and edges. With this partial order, PARD generates a graph in a block-by-block, autoregressive fashion, where each block’s probability is conditionally modeled by a shared diffusion model with an equivariant network. To ensure efficiency while being expressive, we further propose a higher-order graph transformer, which integrates transformer with PPGN (Maronet al., 2019).

Despite the remarkable potential of diffusion models in image generation, current diffusion-based SFR models struggle with generalization to real-world faces. To address this limitation, we outline three key objectives for SFR: (1) promoting diversity across identities (inter-class diversity), (2) ensuring diversity within each identity by injecting various facial attributes (intra-class diversity), and (3) maintaining identity consistency within each identity group (intra-class identity preservation). Inspired by these goals, we introduce a diffusion-fueled SFR model termed $\\\\text{ID}^3$. $\\\\text{ID}^3$ employs an ID-preserving loss to generate diverse yet identity-consistent facial appearances. Theoretically, we show that minimizing this loss is equivalent to maximizing the lower bound of an adjusted conditional log-likelihood over ID-preserving data. This equivalence motivates an ID-preserving sampling algorithm, which operates over an adjusted gradient vector field, enabling the generation of fake face recognition datasets that approximate the distribution of real-world faces.

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory associated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational costs and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward Propagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs and activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers during backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training shallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections. Additionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an appropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not only applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated with all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation. Specifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy to the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5$\\\\times$, and enable training with a sequence length 6.2$\\\\times$ larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU.

While significant work has explored this question, a holistic understanding across different adversarial models and corruption measures is lacking, as is a full characterization of the minimax regret bounds. In this work, we compare two types of corruptions commonly considered: strong corruption, where the corruption level depends on the learner’s chosen action, and weak corruption, where the corruption level does not depend on the learner’s chosen action. We provide a unified framework to analyze these corruptions. For stochastic linear bandits, we fully characterize the gap between the minimax regret under strong and weak corruptions. We also initiate the study of corrupted adversarial linear bandits, obtaining upper and lower bounds with matching dependencies on the corruption level. Next, we reveal a connection between corruption-robust learning and learning with gap-dependent misspecification—a setting first studied by Liu et al.

We present a general reduction that enables any corruption-robust algorithm to handle gap-dependent misspecification. This allows us to recover the results of Liu et al.

We derive a diffusion-based optimal controller inspired by the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm. This framework is fully general and able to handle any differentiable forward measurement operator, including super-resolution, inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, nonlinear deblurring, and even highly nonlinear neural classifiers. Furthermore, we show that the idealized posterior sampling equation can be recovered as a special case of our algorithm.

To tackle this challenge, one promising path is to utilize reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which steers MLLMs towards learning superior responses while avoiding inferior ones. We rethink the common practice of using binary preferences (*i.e.*, superior, inferior), and find that adopting multi-level preferences (*e.g.*, superior, medium, inferior) is better for two benefits: 1) It narrows the gap between adjacent levels, thereby encouraging MLLMs to discern subtle differences. 2) It further integrates cross-level comparisons (beyond adjacent-level comparisons), thus providing a broader range of comparisons with hallucination examples. To verify our viewpoint, we present the Automated Multi-level Preference (**AMP**) framework for MLLMs. To facilitate this framework, we first develop an automated dataset generation pipeline that provides high-quality multi-level preference datasets without any human annotators. Furthermore, we design the Multi-level Direct Preference Optimization (MDPO) algorithm to robustly conduct complex multi-level preference learning. Additionally, we propose a new hallucination benchmark, MRHal-Bench.

Recent works have shown that leveraging neighbor instances can help alleviate this problem. Yet, these works all assume that each instance has the same neighborhood size, which defies common sense. To address this gap, we propose a novel label integration algorithm called K-free nearest neighbor (KFNN). In KFNN, the neighborhood size of each instance is automatically determined based on its attributes and noisy labels. Specifically, KFNN initially estimates a Mahalanobis distance distribution from the attribute space to model the relationship between each instance and all classes. This distance distribution is then utilized to enhance the multiple noisy label distribution of each instance. Subsequently, a Kalman filter is designed to mitigate the impact of noise incurred by neighbor instances. Finally, KFNN determines the optimal neighborhood size by the max-margin learning.

In this paper, we investigate tokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of transformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn from certain simple $k^{\\\\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k > 1$, transformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization, they empirically are incredibly slow or fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters according to a unigram model (Makkuva et al. 2024). With the addition of tokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through this barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from the source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this observation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss achieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate tokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens) learnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn from $k^{\\\\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally.

The ranking information offers valuable guidance for scheduling requests. Building on this insight, we develop a novel scheduler for LLM inference and serving that can approximate the shortest-job-first (SJF) schedule better than existing approaches. We integrate this scheduler with the state-of-the-art LLM serving system and show significant performance improvement in several important applications: 2.8x lower latency in chatbot serving and 6.5x higher throughput in synthetic data generation.

When data clearly reveals underlying symmetry, leveraging this symmetry can naturally inform the design of model architectures or learning strategies. Yet, in numerous real-world scenarios, identifying the specific symmetry within a given data distribution often proves ambiguous. To tackle this, some existing works learn symmetry in a data-driven manner, parameterizing and learning expected symmetry through data. However, these methods often rely on explicit knowledge, such as pre-defined Lie groups, which are typically restricted to linear or affine transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetry learning algorithm based on transformations defined with one-parameter groups, continuously parameterized transformations flowing along the directions of vector fields called infinitesimal generators. Our method is built upon minimal inductive biases, encompassing not only commonly utilized symmetries rooted in Lie groups but also extending to symmetries derived from nonlinear generators. To learn these symmetries, we introduce a notion of a validity score that examine whether the transformed data is still valid for the given task. The validity score is designed to be fully differentiable and easily computable, enabling effective searches for transformations that achieve symmetries innate to the data. We apply our method mainly in two domains: image data and partial differential equations, and demonstrate its advantages.

The classical framework of analysis by synthesis casts this inference as a joint optimization seeking to explain the observed pixels, and recent instantiations learn expressive 3D representations (e.g., Neural Fields) with gradient-descent-based pose refinement of initial pose estimates. However, given a sparse set of observed views, the observations may not provide sufficient direct evidence to obtain complete and accurate 3D. Moreover, large errors in pose estimation may not be easily corrected and can further degrade the inferred 3D. To allow robust 3D reconstruction and pose estimation in this challenging setup, we propose SparseAGS, a method that adapts this analysis-by-synthesis approach by: a) including novel-view-synthesis-based generative priors in conjunction with photometric objectives to improve the quality of the inferred 3D, and b) explicitly reasoning about outliers and using a discrete search with a continuous optimization-based strategy to correct them. We validate our framework across real-world and synthetic datasets in combination with several off-the-shelf pose estimation systems as initialization. We find that it significantly improves the base systems' pose accuracy while yielding high-quality 3D reconstructions that outperform the results from current multi-view reconstruction baselines.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/9deb0cefa84b633dd45b98a2c28dfa4cb9a5847d.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nzhao2024sparseview,\\ntitle={Sparse-view Pose Estimation and Reconstruction via Analysis by Generative Synthesis},\\nauthor={Qitao Zhao and Shubham Tulsiani},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=wgpmDyJgsg}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'zhao|sparseview_pose_estimation_and_reconstruction_via_analysis_by_generative_synthesis'}},forum = 'wgpmDyJgsg',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12647/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12647/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12647/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12647/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude.

We begin with the premise that token merging should not rely solely on the similarity of video tokens; the saliency of tokens should also be considered. To address this, we explore various video token merging strategies for long-form video classification, starting with a simple extension of image token merging, moving to region-concentrated merging, and finally proposing a learnable video token merging (VTM) algorithm that dynamically merges tokens based on their saliency.

These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of self-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

To mitigate this inherent deficiency of the default scatter-point optimization, this paper proposes and theoretically studies a new training paradigm as region optimization.

By calibrating the sampling process into trust regions, RoPINN finely balances optimization and generalization error.

In this work, we approach this issue from an economic perspective, by proposing a pay-for-performance, contract-based framework for incentivizing quality. We study a principal-agent game where the agent generates text using costly inference, and the contract determines the principal’s payment for the text according to an automated quality evaluation. Since standard contract theory is inapplicable when internal inference costs are unknown, we introduce cost-robust contracts. As our main theoretical contribution, we characterize optimal cost-robust contracts through a direct correspondence to optimal composite hypothesis tests from statistics, generalizing a result of Saig et al.

To this end, we craft a new challenging dataset named CounterAnimal designed to reveal the reliance of CLIP models on realistic spurious features. Specifically, we split animal photos into groups according to the backgrounds, and then identify a pair of groups for each class where a CLIP model shows high-performance drops across the two groups. Our evaluations show that the spurious features captured by CounterAnimal are generically learned by CLIP models with different backbones and pre-train data, yet have limited influence for ImageNet models.

While these models acquire strong capabilities, they may not follow the user's intent to output the desired results in certain aspects, e.g., visual aesthetic, preferred style, and responsibility. In this paper, we target the realm of visual aesthetics and aim to align vision models with human aesthetic standards in a retrieval system. Advanced retrieval systems usually adopt a cascade of aesthetic models as re-rankers or filters, which are limited to low-level features like saturation and perform poorly when stylistic, cultural or knowledge contexts are involved. We find that utilizing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) to rephrase the search query and extend the aesthetic expectations can make up for this shortcoming. Based on the above findings, we propose a preference-based reinforcement learning method that fine-tunes the vision models to distill the knowledge from both LLMs reasoning and the aesthetic models to better align the vision models with human aesthetics. Meanwhile, with rare benchmarks designed for evaluating retrieval systems, we leverage large multi-modality model (LMM) to evaluate the aesthetic performance with their strong abilities. As aesthetic assessment is one of the most subjective tasks, to validate the robustness of LMM, we further propose a novel dataset named HPIR to benchmark the alignment with human aesthetics.  Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the aesthetic behaviors of the vision models, under several metrics.

Although many studies have been proposed to address this challenge, the semantic and spurious features are still difficult to accurately decouple from the original image and fail to achieve high performance with deep learning models. This paper proposes a novel perspective inspired by neural collapse to solve the spurious correlation problem through the alternate execution of environment partitioning and learning semantic masks. Specifically, we propose to assign an environment to each sample by learning a local model for each environment and using maximum likelihood probability. At the same time, we require that the learned semantic mask neurally collapses to the same simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) in each environment after being applied to the original input.

One key reason for matching camera rays, instead of pixels as in prior works, is that the camera rays can be parameterized by the feature volume to carry both geometric and photometric information. Multi-view consistencies involving the camera rays and scene rendering can be naturally integrated into the joint optimization and network training, to impose physically meaningful constraints to improve the final quality of both the geometric reconstruction and photorealistic rendering. We formulate our per-ray optimization and matched ray coherence by focusing on camera rays passing through keypoints in the input images to elevate both the efficiency and accuracy of scene correspondences. Accumulated ray features along the feature volume provide a means to discount the coherence constraint amid erroneous ray matching.

We discover a trade-off between sharpness and diversity: minimizing the sharpness in the loss landscape tends to diminish the diversity of individual members within the ensemble, adversely affecting the ensemble's improvement. The trade-off is justified through our rigorous theoretical analysis and verified empirically through extensive experiments. To address the issue of reduced diversity, we introduce SharpBalance, a novel training approach that balances sharpness and diversity within ensembles.

In contrast, the Mamba model is renowned for its efficient ability to process long-term dependencies, which provides an opportunity for in-context RL to solve tasks that require long-term memory.

ELSA supports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captions describing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA: (a) we spatially augment  the audio and captions of three open-source audio datasets totaling 4,738 hours and 890,038 samples of audio comprised from 8,972 simulated spatial configurations, and (b) we design an encoder to capture the semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes of spatial audio using contrastive learning.

In contrast, we analyze the gradient flow dynamics of simultaneously training three attention matrices and a linear MLP layer from random initialization, and provide a framework of analyzing such dynamics via a coupled dynamical system. We establish near minimum loss and characterize the attention model after training. We discover that gradient flow serves as an inherent mechanism that naturally divide the training process into two phases. In Phase 1, the linear MLP quickly aligns with the two target signals for correct classification, whereas the softmax attention remains almost unchanged. In Phase 2, the attention matrices and the MLP evolve jointly to enlarge the classification margin and reduce the loss to a near minimum value.

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a unified approach that integrates the strengths of both paradigms. Considering interleaved image-text sequences as the general format of input samples, we introduce a structure-induced training strategy that imposes semantic relationships between input samples and the MLLM’s hidden state. This approach enhances the MLLM’s ability to capture global semantics and distinguish fine-grained semantics. By leveraging dynamic sequence alignment within the Dynamic Time Warping framework and integrating a novel kernel for fine-grained semantic differentiation, our method effectively balances generative and discriminative tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple generative tasks, especially those requiring cognitive and discrimination abilities. Additionally, our method surpasses discriminative benchmarks in interleaved and fine-grained retrieval tasks.

In this paper, we propose an efficient FL paradigm,  where the local  models in the clients  are trained with  low-precision operations and communicated  with the server in low precision format, while only the model aggregation in the server is performed with  high-precision computation. We surprisingly find that   high precision models can be recovered from the  low precision local models with proper aggregation in the server. \\n     In this way, both the workload in the client-side and the communication cost can be significantly reduced.   We theoretically show that our proposed  paradigm can converge to the optimal solution as the training goes on, which demonstrates that low precision local training is enough for FL.  Our paradigm can be integrated with existing FL algorithms flexibly. Experiments across extensive benchmarks are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the models trained by our method with the precision as low as 8 bits are  comparable  to those from the  full precision training. As a by-product, we show that low precision local training can relieve the over-fitting issue in local training, which under heterogeneous client data  can cause the client models drift further away from each other and lead to the failure in  model aggregation.

Formally, GREAT Score carries the physical meaning of a global statistic capturing a mean certified attack-proof perturbation level over all samples drawn from a generative model. For finite-sample evaluation, we also derive a probabilistic guarantee on the sample complexity and the difference between the sample mean and the true mean. GREAT Score has several advantages: (1) Robustness evaluations using GREAT Score are efficient and scalable to large models, by sparing the need of running adversarial attacks. In particular, we show high correlation and significantly reduced computation cost of GREAT Score when compared to the attack-based model ranking on RobustBench \\\\cite{croce2021robustbench}. (2) The use of generative models facilitates the approximation of the unknown data distribution. In our ablation study with different generative adversarial networks (GANs), we observe consistency between global robustness evaluation and the quality of GANs. (3) GREAT Score can be used for remote auditing of privacy-sensitive black-box models, as demonstrated by our robustness evaluation on several online facial recognition services.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'safety_in_machine_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/9b455fd219afd050f8e2c5821f56718aa6c2426f.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/a2a24d998ffc9934aafecc9a430c810763187870.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nli2024great,\\ntitle={{GREAT} Score: Global Robustness Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbation using Generative Models},\\nauthor={ZAITANG LI and Pin-Yu Chen and Tsung-Yi Ho},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=vunJCq9PwU}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'li|great_score_global_robustness_evaluation_of_adversarial_perturbation_using_generative_models'}},forum = 'vunJCq9PwU',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10918/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10918/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10918/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10918/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Deep Recursive Feature Machines are a method that constructs a neural network by iteratively mapping the data with the AGOP and applying an untrained random feature map. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that DNC occurs in Deep Recursive Feature Machines as a consequence of the projection with the AGOP matrix computed at each layer. We then provide evidence that this mechanism holds for neural networks more generally.

We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks.

One effective solution to enhance this ability is to train the models with manually-blended data, which we termed \\'\\'blendfake\\'\\', encouraging models to learn generic forgery artifacts like blending boundary. Interestingly, current SoTA methods utilize blendfake $\\\\textit{without}$ incorporating any deepfake data in their training process. This is likely because previous empirical observations suggest that vanilla hybrid training (VHT), which combines deepfake and blendfake data, results in inferior performance to methods using only blendfake data (so-called \"1+1<2\"). Therefore, a critical question arises: Can we leave deepfake behind and rely solely on blendfake data to train an effective deepfake detector? Intuitively, as deepfakes also contain additional informative forgery clues ($\\\\textit{e.g.,}$ deep generative artifacts), excluding all deepfake data in training deepfake detectors seems counter-intuitive. In this paper, we rethink the role of blendfake in detecting deepfakes and formulate the process from \"real to blendfake to deepfake\" to be a $\\\\textit{progressive transition}$. Specifically, blendfake and deepfake can be explicitly delineated as the oriented pivot anchors between \"real-to-fake\" transitions. The accumulation of forgery information should be oriented and progressively increasing during this transition process. To this end, we propose an $\\\\underline{O}$riented $\\\\underline{P}$rogressive $\\\\underline{R}$egularizor (OPR) to establish the constraints that compel the distribution of anchors to be discretely arranged. Furthermore, we introduce feature bridging to facilitate the smooth transition between adjacent anchors.

In this work, we propose a Homology Consistency (HC) constraint for efficient transfer on VLMs, which explicitly constrains the correspondence of image and text latent manifolds through structural equivalence based on persistent homology in downstream tuning. Specifically, we build simplicial complex on the top of data to mimic the topology of latent manifolds, then track the persistence of the homology classes of topological features across multiple scales, and guide the directions of persistence tracks in image and text manifolds to coincide each other, with a deviating perturbation additionally.

However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance.

Methods based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) assume the low-rank characteristics of the incremental matrix and optimize the matrix obtained from low-rank decomposition. Although effective, these methods are constrained by a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank, neglecting the variable importance of matrices. Consequently, methods for adaptive rank allocation are proposed, among which AdaLoRA demonstrates excellent fine-tuning performance. AdaLoRA conducts adaptation based on singular value decomposition (SVD), dynamically allocating intrinsic ranks according to importance. However, it still struggles to achieve a balance between fine-tuning effectiveness and efficiency, leading to limited rank allocation space. Additionally, the importance measurement focuses only on parameters with minimal impact on the loss, neglecting the dominant role of singular values in SVD-based matrices and the fluctuations during training. To address these issues, we propose SalientLoRA, which adaptively optimizes intrinsic ranks of LoRA via salience measurement. Firstly, during rank allocation, the salience measurement analyses the variation of singular value magnitudes across multiple time steps and establishes their inter-dependency relationships to assess the matrix importance. This measurement mitigates instability and randomness that may arise during importance assessment. Secondly, to achieve a balance between fine-tuning performance and efficiency, we propose an adaptive adjustment of time-series window, which adaptively controls the size of time-series for significance measurement and rank reduction during training, allowing for rapid rank allocation while maintaining training stability. This mechanism enables matrics to set a higher initial rank, thus expanding the allocation space for ranks. To evaluate the generality of our method across various tasks, we conduct experiments on natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), and large model instruction tuning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SalientLoRA, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.96\\\\%-3.56\\\\% on multiple datasets. Furthermore, as the rank allocation space expands, our method ensures fine-tuning efficiency, achieving a speed improvement of 94.5\\\\% compared to AdaLoRA.

Meanwhile, diffusion models emerged as a powerful framework for multimodal learning. However, the use of diffusion policies in online RL is hindered by the intractability of policy likelihood approximation, as well as the greedy objective of RL methods that can easily skew the policy to a single mode. This paper presents Deep Diffusion Policy Gradient (DDiffPG), a novel actor-critic algorithm that learns from scratch multimodal policies parameterized as diffusion models while discovering and maintaining versatile behaviors. DDiffPG explores and discovers multiple modes through off-the-shelf unsupervised clustering combined with novelty-based intrinsic motivation. DDiffPG forms a multimodal training batch and utilizes mode-specific Q-learning to mitigate the inherent greediness of the RL objective, ensuring the improvement of the diffusion policy across all modes. Our approach further allows the policy to be conditioned on mode-specific embeddings to explicitly control the learned modes. Empirical studies validate DDiffPG's capability to master multimodal behaviors in complex, high-dimensional continuous control tasks with sparse rewards, also showcasing proof-of-concept dynamic online replanning when navigating mazes with unseen obstacles.

To overcome this issue, we introduce \\\\textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align more closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of negative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory bank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images, representing the targeted OOD distribution.

The final score for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our proposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance.

Significant variations in the model output and granularity can occur with simply subtle changes in the prompt, contradicting the consensus requirement for the robustness of a model. While some established works have been dedicated to stabilizing and fortifying the prediction of SAM, this paper takes a unique path to explore how this flaw can be inverted into an advantage when modeling inherently ambiguous data distributions. We introduce an optimization framework based on a conditional variational autoencoder, which jointly models the prompt and the granularity of the object with a latent probability distribution. This approach enables the model to adaptively perceive and represent the real ambiguous label distribution, taming SAM to produce a series of diverse, convincing, and reasonable segmentation outputs controllably. Extensive experiments on several practical deployment scenarios involving ambiguity demonstrates the exceptional performance of our framework.

In this study, we introduce LOVA3, an innovative framework named ``Learning tO Visual Question Answering, Asking and Assessment,'' designed to equip MLLMs with these additional capabilities. Our approach involves the creation of two supplementary training tasks GenQA and EvalQA, aiming at fostering the skills of asking and assessing questions in the context of images. To develop the questioning ability, we compile a comprehensive set of multimodal foundational tasks. For assessment, we introduce a new benchmark called EvalQABench, comprising 64,000 training samples (split evenly between positive and negative samples) and 5,000 testing samples. We posit that enhancing MLLMs with the capabilities to answer, ask, and assess questions \\nwill enhance their multimodal comprehension, ultimately improving overall performance. To validate this hypothesis, we train MLLMs using the LOVA3 framework and evaluate them on a range of multimodal datasets and benchmarks.

Inferring depth from a single image is an ill-posed problem due to the loss of scale from perspective projection during the image formation process. Any scale chosen is a bias, typically stemming from training on a dataset; hence, existing works have instead opted to use relative (normalized, inverse) depth. Our goal is to recover metric-scaled depth maps through a linear transformation. The crux of our method lies in the observation that certain objects (e.g., cars, trees, street signs) are typically found or associated with certain types of scenes (e.g., outdoor). We explore whether language descriptions can be used to transform relative depth predictions to those in metric scale. Our method, RSA , takes as input a text caption describing objects present in an image and outputs the parameters of a linear transformation which can be applied globally to a relative depth map to yield metric-scaled depth predictions. We demonstrate our method on recent general-purpose monocular depth models on indoors (NYUv2, VOID) and outdoors (KITTI). When trained on multiple datasets, RSA can serve as a general alignment module in zero-shot settings. Our method improves over common practices in aligning relative to metric depth and results in predictions that are comparable to an upper bound of fitting relative depth to ground truth via a linear transformation.

In this work, we introduce Direct3D, a native 3D generative model scalable to in-the-wild input images, without requiring a multi-view diffusion model or SDS optimization. Our approach comprises two primary components: a Direct 3D Variational Auto-Encoder (D3D-VAE) and a Direct 3D Diffusion Transformer (D3D-DiT). D3D-VAE efficiently encodes high-resolution 3D shapes into a compact and continuous latent triplane space. Notably, our method directly supervises the decoded geometry using a semi-continuous surface sampling strategy, diverging from previous methods relying on rendered images as supervision signals. D3D-DiT models the distribution of encoded 3D latents and is specifically designed to fuse positional information from the three feature maps of the triplane latent, enabling a native 3D generative model scalable to large-scale 3D datasets. Additionally, we introduce an innovative image-to-3D generation pipeline incorporating semantic and pixel-level image conditions, allowing the model to produce 3D shapes consistent with the provided conditional image input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our large-scale pre-trained Direct3D over previous image-to-3D approaches, achieving significantly better generation quality and generalization ability, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art for 3D content creation.

Our extensive investigation of twelve popular LLMs reveals that their assessed consistency scores are influenced by position bias and selection bias rather than their intrinsic abilities. We propose a new framework tSMC, which gauges the effects of these biases and effectively mitigates the bias impact based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence to pinpoint LLMs' mitigated Symmetric Moral Consistency.

We focus on learning holomorphic operators -- an important class of problems with many applications. We combine arbitrary approximate encoders and decoders with standard feedforward Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures -- specifically, those with constant width exceeding the depth -- under standard $\\\\ell^2$-loss minimization. We first identify a family of  DNNs such that the resulting Deep Learning (DL) procedure achieves optimal generalization bounds for such operators. For standard fully-connected architectures, we then show that there are uncountably many minimizers of the training problem that yield equivalent optimal performance. The DNN architectures we consider are `problem agnostic', with width and depth only depending on the amount of training data $m$ and not on regularity assumptions of the target operator. Next, we show that DL is optimal for this problem: no recovery procedure can surpass these generalization bounds up to log terms.

Heuristics encode prior human knowledge about how a task should be done, providing valuable hints for RL algorithms. However, such hints may not be optimal, limiting the performance of learned policies. \\nThe currently established way of using heuristics is to modify the heuristic reward in a manner that ensures that the optimal policy learned with it remains the same as the optimal policy for the task reward (i.e., optimal policy invariance). \\nHowever, these methods often fail in practical scenarios with limited training data. We found that while optimal policy invariance ensures convergence to the best policy based on task rewards, it doesn't guarantee better performance than policies trained with biased heuristics under a finite data regime, which is impractical. In this paper, we introduce a new principle tailored for finite data settings. Instead of enforcing optimal policy invariance, we train a policy that combines task and heuristic rewards and ensures it outperforms the heuristic-trained policy. As such, we prevent policies from merely exploiting heuristic rewards without improving the task reward. Our experiments on robotic locomotion, helicopter control, and manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the heuristic policy, regardless of the heuristic rewards' quality.\\nCode is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'reinforcement_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/1983230de4f35516ae3297ba7a6fb88fab7fad02.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/55b8dcc3d7045b9166063c32638f97a974040774.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nlee2024going,\\ntitle={Going Beyond Heuristics by Imposing Policy Improvement as a Constraint},\\nauthor={Chi-Chang Lee and Zhang-Wei Hong and Pulkit Agrawal},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=vBGMbFgvsX}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'lee|going_beyond_heuristics_by_imposing_policy_improvement_as_a_constraint'}},forum = 'vBGMbFgvsX',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7607/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7607/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7607/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7607/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS.

A recent trend is to further extend and enhance the perception capabilities of LMMs. The current methods follow the paradigm of adapting the visual task outputs to the format of the language model, which is the main component of a LMM. This adaptation leads to convenient development of such LMMs with minimal modifications, however, it overlooks the intrinsic characteristics of diverse visual tasks and hinders the learning of perception capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel LMM architecture named Lumen, a Large multimodal model with versatile vision-centric capability enhancement. We decouple the LMM's learning of perception capabilities into task-agnostic and task-specific stages. Lumen first promotes fine-grained vision-language concept alignment, which is the fundamental capability for various visual tasks. Thus the output of the task-agnostic stage is a shared representation for all the tasks we address in this paper. Then the task-specific decoding is carried out by flexibly routing the shared representation to lightweight task decoders with negligible training efforts. Comprehensive experimental results on a series of vision-centric and VQA benchmarks indicate that our Lumen model not only achieves or surpasses the performance of existing LMM-based approaches in a range of vision-centric tasks while maintaining general visual understanding and instruction following capabilities.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/f93765d8f6468be09c47280c032485d031a61297.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\njiao2024lumen,\\ntitle={Lumen: Unleashing Versatile Vision-Centric Capabilities of Large Multimodal Models},\\nauthor={Yang Jiao and Shaoxiang Chen and ZEQUN JIE and Jingjing Chen and Lin Ma and Yu-Gang Jiang},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=v5Un2QqnRf}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'jiao|lumen_unleashing_versatile_visioncentric_capabilities_of_large_multimodal_models'}},forum = 'v5Un2QqnRf',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3716/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3716/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3716/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3716/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY-NC 4.0'),\n",

The simulated human is produced either through behavior cloning over a dataset of human cooperation behavior, or by using MARL to create a population of simulated agents. However, these approaches often struggle to produce a Cooperator that can coordinate well with real humans, since the simulated humans fail to cover the diverse strategies and styles employed by people in the real world.

By sampling from the latent space, we can use the generative model to produce different partners to train Cooperator agents. We evaluate our method---Generative Agent Modeling for Multi-agent Adaptation (GAMMA)---on Overcooked, a challenging cooperative cooking game that has become a standard benchmark for zero-shot coordination. We conduct an evaluation with real human teammates, and the results show that GAMMA consistently improves performance, whether the generative model is trained on simulated populations or human datasets.

In light of this, we explore the geometric insights of point clouds, which provide explicit registration priors for reconstruction.

Furthermore, NeRFs tend to overfit individual frames and easily get stuck in local minima under sparse-view inputs. To tackle this issue, we develop a selective-reweighting strategy and introduce geometric constraints for robust optimization.

Going beyond this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (ENP) to model the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model. At each step, low energy values correspond to the state-action pairs that the expert is most likely to perform, and vice versa. Theoretically, the optimization objective is equivalent to minimizing the forward divergence between the occupancy measure of the expert and ours. Consequently, ENP learns to globally align with the expert policy by maximizing the likelihood of the actions and modeling the dynamics of the navigation states in a collaborative manner.

The inherent delays in such settings not only introduce additional bias to the system but also obscure the disruptions caused by Byzantine faults.

To address these challenges, we introduce a new retargeting framework, MeshRet, which directly models the dense geometric interactions in motion retargeting. Initially, we establish dense mesh correspondences between characters using semantically consistent sensors (SCS), effective across diverse mesh topologies. Subsequently, we develop a novel spatio-temporal representation called the dense mesh interaction (DMI) field. This field, a collection of interacting SCS feature vectors, skillfully captures both contact and non-contact interactions between body geometries. By aligning the DMI field during retargeting, MeshRet not only preserves motion semantics but also prevents self-interpenetration and ensures contact preservation. Extensive experiments on the public Mixamo dataset and our newly-collected ScanRet dataset demonstrate that MeshRet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In contrast, our proposed definition yields certification guarantees that depend only on the loss function and the intermediate learned metric spaces of the neural network.

Tasks like 3D semantic segmentation impose a substantial annotation burden, especially in domains like medicine, where expert annotations drive up the cost. Active learning (AL) holds great potential to alleviate this annotation burden in 3D medical segmentation. The majority of existing AL methods, however, are not tailored to the medical domain. While weakly-supervised methods have been explored to reduce annotation burden, the fusion of AL with weak supervision remains unexplored, despite its potential to significantly reduce annotation costs. Additionally, there is little focus on slice-based AL for 3D segmentation, which can also significantly reduce costs in comparison to conventional volume-based AL. This paper introduces a novel metric learning method for Coreset to perform slice-based active learning in 3D medical segmentation. By merging contrastive learning with inherent data groupings in medical imaging, we learn a metric that emphasizes the relevant differences in samples for training 3D medical segmentation models. We perform comprehensive evaluations using both weak and full annotations across four datasets (medical and non-medical). Our findings demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing active learning techniques on both weak and full annotations and obtains superior performance with low-annotation budgets which is crucial in medical imaging.

With rapid advances in representation learning, leveraging abundant recordings to enhance speech decoding is increasingly attractive. However, popular methods often pre-train temporal models based on brain-level tokens, overlooking that brain activities in different regions are highly desynchronized during tasks. Alternatively, they pre-train spatial-temporal models based on channel-level tokens but fail to evaluate them on challenging tasks like speech decoding, which requires intricate processing in specific language-related areas. To address this issue, we collected a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset targeting language-related brain networks from 12 subjects. Using this benchmark, we developed the Du-IN model, which extracts contextual embeddings based on region-level tokens through discrete codex-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 61-word classification task, surpassing all baselines. Model comparisons and ablation studies reveal that our design choices, including (\\\\romannumeral1) temporal modeling based on region-level tokens by utilizing 1D depthwise convolution to fuse channels in the ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and (\\\\romannumeral2) self-supervision through discrete codex-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to this performance. Overall, our approach -- inspired by neuroscience findings and capitalizing on region-level representations from specific brain regions -- is suitable for invasive brain modeling and represents a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in brain-computer interfaces.

Due to their wide-spread adoption for various tasks ranging from few-shot classification to text-guided image generation, debiasing VL models is crucial. Debiasing approaches that fine-tune the VL model often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, fine-tuning-free methods typically utilize a ``one-size-fits-all\" approach that assumes that correlation with the spurious attribute can be explained using a single linear direction across all possible inputs.

The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each modality while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR fusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing pruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus, they struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in camera-LiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on camera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative Modality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each modality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one modality parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the masked backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of the other modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant redundant parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The redundant parameters can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation function, Alternative Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation of the loss changes when certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. Extensive experiments on the nuScene and KITTI datasets encompassing diverse tasks, baseline models, and pruning algorithms showcase that AlterMOMA outperforms existing pruning methods, attaining state-of-the-art performance.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'optimization_for_deep_networks'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/96b5c41a32824f29863a3aebe65b09d5c34a30f7.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nsun2024altermoma,\\ntitle={Alter{MOMA}: Fusion Redundancy Pruning for Camera-Li{DAR} Fusion Models with Alternative Modality Masking},\\nauthor={shiqi sun and Yantao Lu and Ning Liu and Bo Jiang and Jinchao Chen and Ying Zhang},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ujwIlTNrAP}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'sun|altermoma_fusion_redundancy_pruning_for_cameralidar_fusion_models_with_alternative_modality_masking'}},forum = 'ujwIlTNrAP',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4533/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4533/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4533/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4533/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

We think unifying them in the same sequential manner is not optimal for two reasons: 1) parallel recognition is more efficient than sequential recognition and is actually prevailing in deep visual recognition, and 2) the recognition results can be integrated to help high-level cognition (while the current manner does not). Such motivated, this paper proposes a novel “parallel recognition → sequential understanding” framework for MLLMs. The bottom LLM layers are utilized for parallel recognition and the recognition results are relayed into the top LLM layers for sequential understanding. Specifically, parallel recognition in the bottom LLM layers is implemented via object queries, a popular mechanism in DEtection TRansformer, which we find to harmonize well with the LLM layers.

Inspired by meta-learning, we incorporate the test-time optimization into training, performing a step of test-time optimization for each sample in the training batch before really conducting the training optimization over all the training samples. In this way, we obtain a meta-model, the meta-parameter of which is friendly to the test-time optimization.

However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for\\ndependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting.

In this work, we investigate reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model’s internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model’s confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance.

Here, we present $\\\\texttt{IsoNet++}$, an early interaction graph neural network (GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by an *injective alignment* between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in a lazy fashion over multiple *rounds*. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments, and proceed to the next round. Third, $\\\\texttt{IsoNet++}$ incorporates a novel notion of node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention then controlling messages passed across graphs. We consider *node pairs* (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds,\\nresulting in significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods.

Carefully crafted graph learning methods, sophisticated polynomial approximations, and refined coefficient constraints leaded to overfitting, which diminishes the generalization of the models. How to design a model that retains the ability of polynomial-based spectral GNNs to approximate filters while it possesses higher generalization and performance? In this paper, we propose a spectral GNN with triple filter ensemble (TFE-GNN), which extracts homophily and heterophily from graphs with different levels of homophily adaptively while utilizing the initial features. Specifically, the first and second ensembles are combinations of a set of base low-pass and high-pass filters, respectively, after which the third ensemble combines them with two learnable coefficients and yield a graph convolution (TFE-Conv). Theoretical analysis shows that the approximation ability of TFE-GNN is consistent with that of ChebNet under certain conditions, namely it can learn arbitrary filters. TFE-GNN can be viewed as a reasonable combination of two unfolded and integrated excellent spectral GNNs, which motivates it to perform well. Experiments show that TFE-GNN achieves high generalization and new state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'graph_neural_networks'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/c48983151fb063fc13fbbf2529feadc3d40a3cf2.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/7a564db332225eeeee3ce77a9499cd4aa4245742.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nduan2024unifying,\\ntitle={Unifying Homophily and Heterophily for Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Triple Filter Ensembles},\\nauthor={Rui Duan and Mingjian Guang and Junli Wang and Chungang Yan and Hongda Qi and Wenkang Su and Can Tian and Haoran Yang},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=uatPOPWzzU}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'duan|unifying_homophily_and_heterophily_for_spectral_graph_neural_networks_via_triple_filter_ensembles'}},forum = 'uatPOPWzzU',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16798/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16798/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16798/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16798/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Learning problems in physical systems are often characterized as discovering operators that map between function spaces based on a few instances of function pairs. This task frequently presents a severely ill-posed PDE inverse problem. In this work, we propose a novel neural operator architecture based on the attention mechanism, which we coin Nonlocal Attention Operator (NAO), and explore its capability towards developing a foundation physical model. In particular, we show that the attention mechanism is equivalent to a double integral operator that enables nonlocal interactions among spatial tokens, with a data-dependent kernel characterizing the inverse mapping from data to the hidden parameter field of the underlying operator. As such, the attention mechanism extracts global prior information from training data generated by multiple systems, and suggests the exploratory space in the form of a nonlinear kernel map. Consequently, NAO can address ill-posedness and rank deficiency in inverse PDE problems by encoding regularization and achieving generalizability. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate the advantages of NAO over baseline neural models in terms of the generalizability to unseen data resolutions and system states.

Current works often assume the causal graph is known, which may not always be available a priori. Motivated by this challenge, we focus on the causal bandit problem in scenarios where the underlying causal graph is unknown and may include latent confounders. While intervention on the parents of the reward node is optimal in the absence of latent confounders, this is not necessarily the case in general. Instead, one must consider a set of possibly optimal arms/interventions, each being a special subset of the ancestors of the reward node, making causal discovery beyond the parents of the reward node essential. For regret minimization, we identify that discovering the full causal structure is unnecessary; however, no existing work provides the necessary and sufficient components of the causal graph. We formally characterize the set of necessary and sufficient latent confounders one needs to detect or learn to ensure that all possibly optimal arms are identified correctly. We also propose a randomized algorithm for learning the causal graph with a limited number of samples, providing a sample complexity guarantee for any desired confidence level. In the causal bandit setup, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we learn the induced subgraph on ancestors of the reward, along with a necessary and sufficient subset of latent confounders, to construct the set of possibly optimal arms. We show that for our proposed algorithm, the number of intervention samples required to learn the set of possibly optimal arms scales polynomially with respect to the number of nodes.

To alleviate the bias of CLIP vision encoder, we first delve into the inherent behavior of different pre-trained vision encoders and then propose the MoVA, a powerful and novel MLLM, adaptively routing and fusing task-specific vision experts with a coarse-to-fine mechanism.

One of the main challenges in offline IL is the limited support of expert demonstrations, which typically cover only a small fraction of the state-action space. While it may not be feasible to obtain numerous expert demonstrations, it is often possible to gather a larger set of sub-optimal demonstrations. For example, in treatment optimization problems, there are varying levels of doctor treatments available for different chronic conditions. These range from treatment specialists and experienced general practitioners to less experienced general practitioners. Similarly, when robots are trained to imitate humans in routine tasks, they might learn from individuals with different levels of expertise and efficiency. \\n\\nIn this paper, we propose an offline IL approach that leverages the larger set of sub-optimal demonstrations while effectively mimicking expert trajectories. Existing offline IL methods based on behavior cloning or distribution matching often face issues such as overfitting to the limited set of expert demonstrations or inadvertently imitating sub-optimal trajectories from the larger dataset. Our approach, which is based on inverse soft-Q learning, learns from both expert and sub-optimal demonstrations. It assigns higher importance (through learned weights) to aligning with expert demonstrations and lower importance to aligning with sub-optimal ones. A key contribution of our approach, called SPRINQL, is transforming the offline IL problem into a convex optimization over the space of Q functions. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the SPRINQL algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on offline IL benchmarks.

Besides, the design of various components in YOLOs lacks the comprehensive and thorough inspection, resulting in noticeable computational redundancy and limiting the model's capability. It renders the suboptimal efficiency, along with considerable potential for performance improvements. In this work, we aim to further advance the performance-efficiency boundary of YOLOs from both the post-processing and the model architecture. To this end, we first present the consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training of YOLOs, which brings the competitive performance and low inference latency simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce the holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy for YOLOs. We comprehensively optimize various components of YOLOs from both the efficiency and accuracy perspectives, which greatly reduces the computational overhead and enhances the capability. The outcome of our effort is a new generation of YOLO series for real-time end-to-end object detection, dubbed YOLOv10. Extensive experiments show that YOLOv10 achieves the state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across various model scales. For example, our YOLOv10-S is 1.8$\\\\times$ faster than RT-DETR-R18 under the similar AP on COCO, meanwhile enjoying 2.8$\\\\times$ smaller number of parameters and FLOPs. Compared with YOLOv9-C, YOLOv10-B has 46\\\\% less latency and 25\\\\% fewer parameters for the same performance.

This ability to provide information over multiple quantiles of the response makes the CQTE especially valuable in cases where the effect of a treatment is not well-modelled by a location shift, even conditionally on the covariates. Nevertheless, the estimation of the CQTE is challenging and often depends upon the smoothness of the individual quantiles as a function of the covariates rather than smoothness of the CQTE itself. This is in stark contrast to the CATE where it is possible to obtain high-quality estimates  which have less dependency upon the smoothness of the nuisance parameters when the CATE itself is smooth. Moreover, relative smoothness of the CQTE lacks the interpretability of smoothness of the CATE making it less clear whether it is a reasonable assumption to make. We combine the desirable properties of the CATE and CQTE by considering a new estimand, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC). The CQC not only retains information about the whole treatment distribution, similar to the CQTE, but also having more natural examples of smoothness and is able to leverage simplicity in an auxiliary estimand. We provide finite sample bounds on the error of our estimator, demonstrating its ability to exploit simplicity. We validate our theory in numerical simulations which show that our method produces more accurate estimates than baselines.

The key challenge lies in identifying important components useful to the model’s predictions. We apply model editing to address two active areas of research, Structured Pruning, and Selective Class Forgetting. In this work, we adopt a distributional approach to the problem of identifying important components, leveraging the recently proposed discriminative filters hypothesis, which states that well-trained (convolutional) models possess discriminative filters that are essential to prediction. To do so, we define discriminative ability in terms of the Bayes error rate associated with the feature distributions, which is equivalent to computing the Total Variation (TV) distance between the distributions. However, computing the TV distance is intractable, motivating us to derive novel witness function-based lower bounds on the TV distance that require no assumptions on the underlying distributions; using this bound generalizes prior work such as Murti et al. [39] that relied on unrealistic Gaussianity assumptions on the feature distributions. With these bounds, we are able to discover critical subnetworks responsible for classwise predictions, and derive DISCEDIT-SP and DISCEDIT-U , algorithms for structured pruning requiring no access to the training data and loss function, and selective forgetting respectively. We apply DISCEDIT-U to selective class forgetting on models trained on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and we show that on average, we can reduce accuracy on a single class by over 80% with a minimal reduction in test accuracy on the remaining classes.

Although some works try to integrate both, they apply the two operators simultaneously at the finest pixel granularity. With Convs responsible for per-pixel feature extraction already, the question is whether we still need to include the heavy MHSAs at such a fine-grained level. In fact, this is the root cause of the scalability issue w.r.t. the input resolution for vision transformers. To address this important problem, we propose in this work to use MSHAs and Convs in parallel \\\\textbf{at different granularity levels} instead. Specifically, in each layer, we use two different ways to represent an image: a fine-grained regular grid and a coarse-grained set of semantic slots. We apply different operations to these two representations: Convs to the grid for local features, and MHSAs to the slots for global features. A pair of fully differentiable soft clustering and dispatching modules is introduced to bridge the grid and set representations, thus \\nenabling local-global fusion.

Our visualization results also demonstrate that the soft clustering module produces a meaningful semantic grouping effect with only IN1k classification supervision, which may induce better interpretability and inspire new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation approaches.

Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input.

Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower  collective urban intelligence, which  reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain  to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as  self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects  to be  exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks  by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

Alternatively, there exists a wide range of expert models that contain diversified vision and/or language knowledge pre-trained on different modalities, tasks, networks, and datasets. Unfortunately, these models are \"isolated agents\" with heterogeneous structures, and how to integrate their knowledge for generalizing CLIP-like models has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a general and concise TransAgent framework, which transports the knowledge of the isolated agents in a unified manner, and effectively guides CLIP to generalize with multi-source knowledge distillation. With such a distinct framework, we flexibly collaborate with 11 heterogeneous agents to empower vision-language foundation models, without further cost in the inference phase.

By integrating selected news events with time series data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_learning_for_other_sciences_and_fields'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/ee49cee9662dd2a8cae6583a9b82aff4cb4b5298.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nwang2024from,\\ntitle={From News to Forecast: Integrating Event Analysis in {LLM}-Based Time Series Forecasting with Reflection},\\nauthor={Xinlei Wang and Maike Feng and Jing Qiu and Jinjin Gu and Junhua Zhao},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=tj8nsfxi5r}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'wang|from_news_to_forecast_integrating_event_analysis_in_llmbased_time_series_forecasting_with_reflection'}},forum = 'tj8nsfxi5r',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5288/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5288/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5288/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5288/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

To adapt the COGEX model to a new task, we introduce a method for performing program search to find a single program whose pseudo-execution yields optimal performance when applied to all the instances of a given dataset.

To create more knowledgeable agents, leveraging knowledge from large language models (LLMs) has shown a promising way. Despite various attempts to combine LLMs with RL, there is commonly a semantic gap between action signals and LLM tokens, which hinders their integration. This paper introduces a novel approach, KALM (Knowledgeable Agents from Language Model Rollouts), to learn knowledgeable agents by bridging this gap. KALM extracts knowledge from LLMs in the form of imaginary rollouts, which agents can learn through offline RL. To overcome the limitation that LLMs are inherently text-based and may be incompatible with numerical environmental data, KALM fine-tunes the LLM to perform bidirectional translation between textual goals and rollouts. This process enables the LLM to understand the environment better, facilitating the generation of meaningful rollouts. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that KALM allows agents to rephrase complex goals and tackle novel tasks requiring new optimal behaviors. KALM achieves a 46% success rate in completing 1400 various novel goals, significantly outperforming the 26% success rate of baseline methods.

To do this, we establish a unified projection space defined by a learnable projection matrix, for similarity calculation across all self-attention layers. As a result, deep image feature extraction remains a per-layer optimization manner, while similarity modeling is carried out by projecting these image features onto the shared projection space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed UPS achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to leading lightweight SISR methods, as verified by various popular benchmarks.

However, unlike standard policy learning, the presence of a human expert can mitigate some of these risks.

To achieve both goals, a mainstream class of LLM unlearning methods introduces an optimization framework with a combination of two objectives – maximizing the prediction loss on the forget documents while minimizing that on the retain documents, which suffers from two challenges, degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a novel unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), which introduces an assistant LLM that aims to achieve the opposite of the unlearning goals: remembering the forget documents and forgetting the retain knowledge. ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by computing the logit difference between the target and the assistant LLMs. We show that such reversed objectives would naturally resolve both aforementioned challenges while significantly improving the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method efficiently achieves the intended forgetting while preserving the LLM’s overall capabilities, reducing training time by more than threefold.

By controlling the magnitude of the activation of the additional relaxation term, we allow the model to optimize over a larger hypothesis space containing approximate equivariant networks and converge back to an equivariant solution at the end of training.

In this work, we analyze the cause of this phenomenon and the limitations of the current solutions, and propose to conduct synchronized modeling via a new framework named SyncVIS. Specifically, SyncVIS explicitly introduces video-level query embeddings and designs two key modules to synchronize video-level query with frame-level query embeddings: a synchronized video-frame modeling paradigm and a synchronized embedding optimization strategy. The former attempts to promote the mutual learning of frame- and video-level embeddings with each other and the latter divides large video sequences into small clips for easier optimization.

Recent progress has demonstrated that recurrent reinforcement learning (RL), which consists of a context encoder based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for unobservable state prediction and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy for decision making, can mitigate partial observability and serve as a robust baseline for POMDP tasks. However, prior recurrent RL algorithms have faced issues with training instability. In this paper, we find that this instability stems from the autoregressive nature of RNNs, which causes even small changes in RNN parameters to produce large output variations over long trajectories. Therefore, we propose **R**ecurrent Off-policy RL with Context-**E**ncoder-**S**p**e**cific **L**earning Rate (RESeL) to tackle this issue. Specifically, RESeL uses a lower learning rate for context encoder than other MLP layers to ensure the stability of the former while maintaining the training efficiency of the latter. We integrate this technique into existing off-policy RL methods, resulting in the RESeL algorithm. We evaluated RESeL in 18 POMDP tasks, including classic, meta-RL, and credit assignment scenarios, as well as five MDP locomotion tasks. The experiments demonstrate significant improvements in training stability with RESeL. Comparative results show that RESeL achieves notable performance improvements over previous recurrent RL baselines in POMDP tasks, and is competitive with or even surpasses state-of-the-art methods in MDP tasks. Further ablation studies highlight the necessity of applying a distinct learning rate for the context encoder.

AlphaLLM is comprised of prompt synthesis component, an efficient MCTS approach tailored for language tasks, and a trio of critic models for precise feedback.

Tokenization, which transforms images into latent representations, reduces computational demands compared to directly processing pixels and enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the generation process. Prior methods, such as VQGAN, typically utilize 2D latent grids with fixed downsampling factors. However, these 2D tokenizations face challenges in managing the inherent redundancies present in images, where adjacent regions frequently display similarities. To overcome this issue, we introduce **T**ransformer-based 1-D**i**mensional **Tok**enizer (TiTok), an innovative approach that tokenizes images into 1D latent sequences. TiTok provides a more compact latent representation, yielding substantially more efficient and effective representations than conventional techniques. For example, a 256 × 256 × 3 image can be reduced to just **32** discrete tokens, a significant reduction from the 256 or 1024 tokens obtained by prior methods. Despite its compact nature, TiTok achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, using the same generator framework, TiTok attains **1.97** gFID, outperforming MaskGIT baseline significantly by 4.21 at ImageNet 256 × 256 benchmark. The advantages of TiTok become even more significant when it comes to higher resolution. At ImageNet 512 × 512 benchmark, TiTok not only outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion model DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.74 vs. 3.04), but also reduces the image tokens by 64×, leading to **410× faster** generation process. Our best-performing variant can significantly surpasses DiT-XL/2 (gFID **2.13** vs. 3.04) while still generating high-quality samples **74× faster**.

Our method encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation VoxSplat, which is a set of 3D Gaussians supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel scaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a feedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates high-resolution grids progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the appearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few as 3 non-overlapping input images, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians with a 10243 voxel grid spanning hundreds of meters in 20 seconds. Past works tackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization and fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense view coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution models, which produce blurry results. In contrast, SCube leverages high-resolution sparse networks and produces sharp outputs from few views.

However, existing frameworks often grapple with the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. While the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) offers an efficient single-step purification, it falls short in ensuring purified images reside on the data manifold. Conversely, the Stochastic Diffusion Model effectively places purified images on the data manifold but demands solving cumbersome stochastic differential equations, while its derivative, the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE), though solving simpler ordinary differential equations, still requires multiple computational steps. In this work, we demonstrated that an ideal purification pipeline should generate the purified images on the data manifold that are as much semantically aligned to the original images for effectiveness in one step for efficiency. Therefore, we introduced Consistency Purification, an efficiency-effectiveness Pareto superior purifier compared to the previous work. Consistency Purification employs the consistency model, a one-step generative model distilled from PF-ODE, thus can generate on-manifold purified images with a single network evaluation. However, the consistency model is designed not for purification thus it does not inherently ensure semantic alignment between purified and original images. To resolve this issue, we further refine it through Consistency Fine-tuning with LPIPS loss, which enables more aligned semantic meaning while keeping the purified images on data manifold.

Existing methods are designed to preserve effective information of old models or graph data to alleviate forgetting, but there is no clear theoretical understanding of what matters in information preservation. In this paper, we consider that present practice suffers from high semantic and structural shifts assessed by two devised shift metrics. We provide insights into information preservation in GCIL and find that maintaining graph information can preserve information of old models in theory to calibrate node semantic and graph structure shifts. We correspond graph information into low-frequency local-global information and high-frequency information in spatial domain. Based on the analysis, we propose a framework, Graph Spatial Information Preservation (GSIP). Specifically, for low-frequency information preservation, the old node representations obtained by inputting replayed nodes into the old model are aligned with the outputs of the node and its neighbors in the new model, and then old and new outputs are globally matched after pooling. For high-frequency information preservation, the new node representations are encouraged to imitate the near-neighbor pair similarity of old node representations.

Recent AD methods have evolved with the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing few-shot anomaly detection capabilities. However, these latest AD methods still exhibit limitations in accuracy improvement. One contributing factor is their direct comparison of a query image's features with those of few-shot normal images. This direct comparison often leads to a loss of precision and complicates the extension of these techniques to more complex domains—an area that remains underexplored in a more refined and comprehensive manner. To address these limitations, we introduce the anomaly personalization method, which performs a personalized one-to-normal transformation of query images using an anomaly-free customized generation model, ensuring close alignment with the normal manifold. Moreover, to further enhance the stability and robustness of prediction results, we propose a triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, which incorporates a comprehensive comparison between the query and generated anomaly-free data pool and prompt information. Extensive evaluations across eleven datasets in three domains demonstrate our model's effectiveness compared to the latest AD methods. Additionally, our method has been proven to transfer flexibly to other AD methods, with the generated image data effectively improving the performance of other AD methods.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/43f475dae8e0821e8b1877670670acd11b6832df.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nli2024onetonormal,\\ntitle={One-to-Normal: Anomaly Personalization for Few-shot Anomaly Detection},\\nauthor={Yiyue Li and Shaoting Zhang and Kang Li and Qicheng Lao},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=tIzW3l2uaN}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'li|onetonormal_anomaly_personalization_for_fewshot_anomaly_detection'}},forum = 'tIzW3l2uaN',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14653/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14653/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14653/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14653/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

However, these T2I generation models often fail to generate images that precisely match the details of the text inputs, such as incorrect spatial relationship or missing objects. In this paper, we introduce SELMA: Skill-Specific Expert Learning and Merging with Auto-Generated Data, a novel paradigm to improve the faithfulness of T2I models by fine-tuning models on automatically generated, multi-skill image-text datasets, with skill-specific expert learning and merging. First, SELMA leverages an LLM’s in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts. Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging. Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge conflict from different datasets. We empirically demonstrate that SELMA significantly improves the semantic alignment and text faithfulness of state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models on multiple benchmarks (+2.1% on TIFA and +6.9% on DSG), human preference metrics (PickScore, ImageReward, and HPS), as well as human evaluation. Moreover, fine-tuning with image-text pairs auto-collected via SELMA shows comparable performance to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with images from a weaker T2I model can help improve the generation quality of a stronger T2I model, suggesting promising weak-to-strong generalization in T2I models.

This optimization instability can prevent GAIL from finding a good policy, harming its final performance. In this paper, we study GAIL’s optimization from a control-theoretic perspective.

In response, we analyze the training dynamics of GAIL in function space and design a novel controller that not only pushes GAIL to the desired equilibrium but also achieves asymptotic stability in a simplified “one-step” setting. Going from theory to practice, we propose Controlled-GAIL (C-GAIL), which adds a differentiable regularization term on the GAIL objective to stabilize training.

With this question in mind, we further conduct qualitative and quantitative pre-experiments, which validate the negative impact of detection-segmentation imbalance issue on the model performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes DI-MaskDINO model, the core idea of which is to improve the final performance by alleviating the detection-segmentation imbalance. DI-MaskDINO is implemented by configuring our proposed De-Imbalance (DI) module and Balance-Aware Tokens Optimization (BATO) module to MaskDINO. DI is responsible for generating balance-aware query, and BATO uses the balance-aware query to guide the optimization of the initial feature tokens. The balance-aware query and optimized feature tokens are respectively taken as the Query and Key&Value of transformer decoder to perform joint object detection and instance segmentation.

Such languages offer domain-specific optimizations and abstractions that improve code readability and maintainability.  However, leveraging these languages requires developers to rewrite existing code using the specific DSL's API. While large language models (LLMs) have shown some success in automatic code transpilation, none of them provide any functional correctness guarantees on the rewritten code. Another approach for automating this task is verified lifting, which relies on program synthesis to find programs in the target language that are functionally equivalent to the source language program. While several verified lifting tools have been developed for various application domains, they are specialized for specific source-target languages or require significant expertise in domain knowledge to make the search efficient. In this paper, leveraging recent advances in LLMs, we propose an LLM-based approach (LLMLift) to building verified lifting tools. We use the LLM's capabilities to reason about programs to translate a given program into its corresponding equivalent in the target language. Additionally, we use LLMs to generate proofs for functional equivalence. We develop lifting-based compilers for four DSLs targeting different application domains.

For fine-grained editing and manipulation, they also require fine-grained semantic or instance maps that are tedious to produce manually. While prompt compliance can be enhanced by addition of loss functions at inference, this is time consuming and does not scale to complex scenes. \\n  To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a new family of  $\\\\textit{Factor Graph Diffusion Models}$ (FG-DMs) that models the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables, such as semantic, sketch, depth or normal maps via a factor graph decomposition. This joint structure has several advantages, including support for efficient sampling based prompt compliance schemes, which produce images of high object recall, semi-automated fine-grained editing, explainability at intermediate levels, ability to produce labeled datasets for the training of downstream models such as segmentation or depth, training with missing data, and continual learning where new conditioning variables can be added with minimal or no modifications to the existing structure. We propose an implementation of FG-DMs by adapting a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to implement all FG-DM factors, using only COCO dataset, and show that it is effective in generating images with 15\\\\% higher recall than SD while retaining its generalization ability. We introduce an attention distillation loss that encourages consistency among the attention maps of all factors, improving the fidelity of the generated conditions and image.

In this paper, we propose **OneRef**, a minimalist referring framework built on the modality-shared one-tower transformer that unifies the visual and linguistic feature spaces. To modeling the referential relationship, we introduce a novel MVLM paradigm called Mask Referring Modeling (**MRefM**), which encompasses both referring-aware mask image modeling and referring-aware mask language modeling. Both modules not only reconstruct modality-related content but also cross-modal referring content. Within MRefM, we propose a referring-aware dynamic image masking strategy that is aware of the referred region rather than relying on fixed ratios or generic random masking schemes. By leveraging the unified visual language feature space and incorporating MRefM's ability to model the referential relations, our approach enables direct regression of the referring results without resorting to various complex techniques.

For example, mentioning  ''black people'' and ''houses''  separately in prompts may not exhibit stereotypes. Nevertheless, when these two objects are associated in prompts, the association of ''black people'' with ''poorer houses'' becomes more pronounced. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework, MAS, to Mitigate Association-engendered Stereotypes. This framework models the stereotype problem as a probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the stereotype probability distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. The MAS framework primarily consists of the *Prompt-Image-Stereotype CLIP* (*PIS CLIP*) and *Sensitive Transformer*. The *PIS CLIP* learns the association between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can establish the mapping of prompts to stereotypes. The *Sensitive Transformer* produces the sensitive constraints, which guide the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution. Moreover, recognizing that existing metrics are insufficient for accurately evaluating association-engendered stereotypes, we propose a novel metric, *Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation*(*SDTV*), to evaluate stereotypes in T2I.

The KV cache stores key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and extensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel depth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM inference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states exhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep portion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states into the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of the state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we introduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs unmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage overhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV cache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity.  We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression ratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with cross-layer merging achieves a compression ratio of $1.53\\\\times$.

To achieve efficient pruning and accurate vicinity characterization, we further propose a novel overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance, which retains only the most likely overlapping points for local measurement and next level exploration. The modeling process essentially involves traversing a pair of HSTs synchronously and aggregating the consistency measures of corresponding tree nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate HST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'TLDR': {'value': 'We present Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree, a pruned tree structure designed to hierarchically measure the multi-scale consistency of coarse correspondences for point cloud registration.'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/ee535dc856d1d4bea09ea0ea17affe9d466274a5.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nren2024multiscale,\\ntitle={Multi-scale Consistency for Robust 3D Registration via Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree},\\nauthor={Chengwei Ren and Yifan Feng and Weixiang Zhang and Xiao-Ping Zhang and Yue Gao},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=sfPxUqzdPI}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'ren|multiscale_consistency_for_robust_3d_registration_via_hierarchical_sinkhorn_tree'}},forum = 'sfPxUqzdPI',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2829/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2829/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2829/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2829/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Previous OCD methods employ the hash-based technique to represent old/new categories by hash codes for instance-wise inference. However, directly mapping features into low-dimensional hash space not only inevitably damages the ability to distinguish classes and but also causes ``high sensitivity'' issue, especially for fine-grained classes, leading to inferior performance. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel Prototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) framework consisting of Category-aware Prototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE) to mitigate the sensitivity of hash code while preserving rich discriminative information contained in high-dimension feature space, in a two-stage projection fashion. CPG enables the model to fully capture the intra-category diversity by representing each category with multiple prototypes. DCE boosts the discrimination ability of hash code with the guidance of the generated category prototypes and the constraint of minimum separation distance. By jointly optimizing CPG and DCE, we demonstrate that these two components are mutually beneficial towards an effective OCD. Extensive experiments show the significant superiority of our PHE over previous methods, e.g. obtaining an improvement of +5.3% in ALL ACC averaged on all datasets. Moreover, due to the nature of the interpretable prototypes, we visually analyze the underlying mechanism of how PHE helps group certain samples into either known or unknown categories.

However, since the fluid is usually observed from the Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are seriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges to the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined paradigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting the future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover hidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of adaptively sampled key particles. Further, DeepLag presents a new paradigm for fluid prediction, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is inferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics information is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide future prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a transparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model free from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better efficiency. Experimentally, DeepLag excels in three challenging fluid prediction tasks covering 2D and 3D, simulated and real-world fluids.

However, these models require substantial computing resources because of the multi-step denoising process during inference. While traditional pruning methods have been employed to optimize these models, the retraining process necessitates large-scale training datasets and extensive computational costs to maintain generalization ability, making it neither convenient nor efficient. Recent studies attempt to utilize the similarity of features across adjacent denoising stages to reduce computational costs through simple and static strategies. However, these strategies cannot fully harness the potential of the similar feature patterns across adjacent timesteps. In this work, we propose a novel pruning method that derives an efficient diffusion model via a more intelligent and differentiable pruner. At the core of our approach is casting the model pruning process into a SubNet search process. Specifically, we first introduce a SuperNet based on standard diffusion via adding some backup connections built upon the similar features. We then construct a plugin pruner network and design optimization losses to identify redundant computation. Finally, our method can identify an optimal SubNet through few-step gradient optimization and a simple post-processing procedure.

Recent studies have shown that the transferability of adversarial examples exists for CNNs, and the same holds true for ViTs. However, existing ViT attacks aggressively regularize the largest token gradients to exact zero within each layer of the surrogate model, overlooking the interactions between layers, which limits their transferability in attacking black-box models. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on boosting the transferability of adversarial attacks on ViTs through adaptive token tuning (ATT). Specifically, we propose three optimization strategies: an adaptive gradient re-scaling strategy to reduce the overall variance of token gradients, a self-paced patch out strategy to enhance the diversity of input tokens, and a hybrid token gradient truncation strategy to weaken the effectiveness of attention mechanism. We demonstrate that scaling correction of gradient changes using gradient variance across different layers can produce highly transferable adversarial examples. In addition, introducing attentional truncation can mitigate the overfitting over complex interactions between tokens in deep ViT layers to further improve the transferability. On the other hand, using feature importance as a guidance to discard a subset of perturbation patches in each iteration, along with combining self-paced learning and progressively more sampled attacks, significantly enhances the transferability over attacks that use all perturbation patches. Extensive experiments conducted on ViTs, undefended CNNs, and defended CNNs validate the superiority of our proposed ATT attack method. On average, our approach improves the attack performance by 10.1% compared to state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks. Notably, we achieve the best attack performance with an average of 58.3% on three defended CNNs.

Several approaches aim to reduce the heterogeneity of multi-omic data while maintaining the discriminability of cell types with extensive annotated data. However, in reality, the cost of collecting both a large amount of labeled scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data is expensive. Therefore, this paper explores a practical yet underexplored problem of knowledge transfer across multi-omic single-cell data under cell type scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised knowledge transfer framework named Dual label scArcity elimiNation with Cross-omic multi-samplE Mixup (DANCE). To overcome the label scarcity in scRNA-seq data, we generate pseudo-labels based on optimal transport and merge them into the labeled scRNA-seq data. Moreover, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy which divides the scATAC-seq data into source-like and target-specific data. For source-like samples, we employ consistency regularization with random perturbations while for target-specific samples, we select a few candidate labels and progressively eliminate incorrect cell types from the label set for additional supervision. Next, we generate virtual scRNA-seq samples with multi-sample Mixup based on the class-wise similarity to reduce cell heterogeneity.

We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training models ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with various vocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches for predicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge on the conclusion that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the compute budget, with larger models requiring larger vocabularies. Most LLMs, however, use insufficient vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal vocabulary size of Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K, 7 times larger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically by training models with 3B parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performance over commonly used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional 32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to 32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs.

In this paper, we propose CultureLLM, a cost-effective solution to integrate cultural differences into LLMs. CultureLLM employs the World Value Survey (WVS) as seed data and generates semantically equivalent training data through the proposed semantic data augmentation. Utilizing only $50$ seed samples from WVS with augmented data, we fine-tune culture-specific LLMs as well as a unified model (CultureLLM-One) for $9$ cultures, encompassing both rich and low-resource languages. Extensive experiments conducted on $60$ culture-related datasets reveal that CultureLLM significantly surpasses various counterparts such as GPT-3.5 (by $8.1$\\\\%) and Gemini Pro (by $9.5$\\\\%), demonstrating performance comparable to or exceeding that of GPT-4.

This task is challenging due to the need to adapt to various photo poses, the sensitivity of hairstyles, and the lack of objective metrics. The current state of the art hairstyle transfer methods use an optimization process for different parts of the approach, making them inexcusably slow. At the same time, faster encoder-based models are of very low quality because they either operate in StyleGAN's W+ space or use other low-dimensional image generators. Additionally, both approaches have a problem with hairstyle transfer when the source pose is very different from the target pose, because they either don't consider the pose at all or deal with it inefficiently. In our paper, we present the HairFast model, which uniquely solves these problems and achieves high resolution, near real-time performance, and superior reconstruction compared to optimization problem-based methods. Our solution includes a new architecture operating in the FS latent space of StyleGAN, an enhanced inpainting approach, and improved encoders for better alignment, color transfer, and a new encoder for post-processing. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on realism metrics after random hairstyle transfer and reconstruction when the original hairstyle is transferred.

One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a na\\\\\"ive generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce GSGAN, a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene.

It can provide deep insights into the behavior of systems evolving in time, as typically described by differential or recursive equations. A common approach to facilitate mathematical tractability and interpretability of DS models involves decomposing nonlinear DS into multiple linear DS combined by switching manifolds, i.e. piecewise linear (PWL) systems. PWL models are popular in engineering and a frequent choice in mathematics for analyzing the topological properties of DS. However, hand-crafting such models is tedious and only possible for very low-dimensional scenarios, while inferring them from data usually gives rise to unnecessarily complex representations with very many linear subregions. Here we introduce Almost-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs) which automatically and robustly produce most parsimonious PWL representations of DS from time series data, using as few PWL nonlinearities as possible. AL-RNNs can be efficiently trained with any SOTA algorithm for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR), and naturally give rise to a symbolic encoding of the underlying DS that provably preserves important topological properties. We show that for the Lorenz and Rössler systems, AL-RNNs derive, in a purely data-driven way, the known topologically minimal PWL representations of the corresponding chaotic attractors.

Although memorization is widely believed to have a close relationship with the strong generalizability of deep learning when using overparameterized models, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no theoretical study on the generalizability of memorization neural networks. In this paper, we give the first theoretical analysis of this topic. Since using i.i.d. training data is a necessary condition for a learning algorithm to be generalizable, memorization and its generalization theory for i.i.d. datasets are developed under mild conditions on the data distribution. First, algorithms are given to construct memorization networks for an i.i.d. dataset, which have the smallest number of parameters and even a constant number of parameters. Second, we show that, in order for the memorization networks to be generalizable, the width of the network must be at least equal to the dimension of the data, which implies that the existing memorization networks with an optimal number of parameters are not generalizable. Third, a lower bound for the sample complexity of general memorization algorithms and the exact sample complexity for memorization algorithms with constant number of parameters are given. As a consequence, it is shown that there exist data distributions such that, to be generalizable for them, the memorization network must have an exponential number of parameters in the data dimension.

Previous methods typically improve the imperceptibility of attacks by integrating common attack paradigms with specifically designed perception-based losses or the capabilities of generative models. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Attacks in Diffusion (AdvAD), a novel modeling framework distinct from existing attack paradigms. AdvAD innovatively conceptualizes attacking as a non-parametric diffusion process by theoretically exploring basic modeling approach rather than using the denoising or generation abilities of regular diffusion models requiring neural networks. At each step, much subtler yet effective adversarial guidance is crafted using only the attacked model without any additional network, which gradually leads the end of diffusion process from the original image to a desired imperceptible adversarial example. Grounded in a solid theoretical foundation of the proposed non-parametric diffusion process, AdvAD achieves high attack efficacy and imperceptibility with intrinsically lower overall perturbation strength. Additionally, an enhanced version AdvAD-X is proposed to evaluate the extreme of our novel framework under an ideal scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AdvAD and AdvAD-X. Compared with state-of-the-art imperceptible attacks, AdvAD achieves an average of 99.9% (+17.3%) ASR with 1.34 (-0.97) $l_2$ distance, 49.74 (+4.76) PSNR and 0.9971 (+0.0043) SSIM against four prevalent DNNs with three different architectures on the ImageNet-compatible dataset.

Recent work has studied these mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing insights on how information is stored in a model's parameters and how information flows to and from these parameters in response to specific prompts. However, these studies have not yet been extended to Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Given their expanding capabilities and real-world use, we start by studying one aspect of these models -- how MLLMs process information in a factual visual question answering task. We use a constraint-based formulation which views a visual question as having a set of visual or textual constraints that the model's generated answer must satisfy to be correct (e.g. What movie directed by \\\\emph{the director in this photo} has won a \\\\emph{Golden Globe}?). Under this setting, we contribute i) a method that extends causal information tracing from pure language to the multi-modal setting, and ii) \\\\emph{VQA-Constraints}, a test-bed of 9.7K visual questions annotated with constraints. We use these tools to study two open-source MLLMs, LLaVa and multi-modal Phi-2. Our key findings show that these MLLMs rely on MLP and self-attention blocks in much earlier layers for information storage, compared to LLMs whose mid-layer MLPs are more important.

Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression-based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining.

Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be data-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Data-Adaptive Positional Encoding (DAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that DAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information.

However, the emergence of open-world SSL (OwSSL) introduces a more practical challenge, wherein unlabeled data may encompass samples from unseen classes. This scenario leads to misclassification of unseen classes as known ones, consequently undermining classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, this study revisits two methodologies from self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, self-labeling and consistency, tailoring them to address the OwSSL problem. Specifically, we propose an effective framework called _OwMatch_, combining conditional self-labeling and open-world hierarchical thresholding.  Theoretically, we analyze the estimation of class distribution on unlabeled data through rigorous statistical analysis, thus demonstrating that OwMatch can ensure the unbiasedness of the label assignment estimator with reliability.  Comprehensive empirical analyses demonstrate that our method yields substantial performance enhancements across both known and unknown classes in comparison to previous studies.

In particular, we give a sparse sketching method running in optimal space and current matrix multiplication time, which recovers a nearly-unbiased least squares estimator using two passes over the data. This leads to new communication-efficient distributed averaging algorithms for least squares and related tasks, which directly improve on several prior approaches.

To achieve robust speculative decoding, Sequoia uses a novel sampling and verification method that outperforms prior work across different decoding temperatures. Sequoia improves the decoding speed of Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Vicuna-33B on an A100 GPU by up to $4.04\\\\times$, $3.73\\\\times$, and $2.27 \\\\times$. To serve Llama3-70B-Instruct on a single L40 GPU through offloading, Sequoia reduces the per-token decoding latency to 0.60 s/token, $9.5\\\\times$ faster than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'natural_language_processing'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 spotlight'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/b37bd645defe5a17e94f0ba7ac5d5cb2c3db1b4f.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/768ce5b70a01106626089286159218399d390b88.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nchen2024sequoia,\\ntitle={Sequoia: Scalable and Robust Speculative Decoding},\\nauthor={Zhuoming Chen and Avner May and Ruslan Svirschevski and Yu-Hsun Huang and Max Ryabinin and Zhihao Jia and Beidi Chen},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rk2L9YGDi2}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'chen|sequoia_scalable_and_robust_speculative_decoding'}},forum = 'rk2L9YGDi2',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2560/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2560/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2560/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission2560/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

LLMs have become increasingly powerful, but their large parameter counts make them computationally expensive.  Existing pruning methods for compressing LLMs primarily focus on evaluating redundancies and removing element-wise weights.  However, these methods fail to allocate adaptive layer-wise sparsities, leading to performance degradation in challenging tasks.  We observe that per-layer importance statistics can serve as allocation indications, but their effectiveness depends on the allocation function between layers.  To address this issue, we develop an expression discovery framework to explore potential allocation strategies.  Our allocation functions involve two steps: reducing element-wise metrics to per-layer importance scores, and modelling layer importance to sparsity ratios.  To search for the most effective allocation function, we construct a search space consisting of pre-process, reduction, transform, and post-process operations.  We leverage an evolutionary algorithm to perform crossover and mutation on superior candidates within the population, guided by performance evaluation.  Finally, we seamlessly integrate our discovered functions into various uniform methods, resulting in significant performance improvements.  We conduct extensive experiments on multiple challenging tasks such as arithmetic, knowledge reasoning, and multimodal benchmarks spanning GSM8K, MMLU, SQA, and VQA, demonstrating that our DSA method achieves significant performance gains on the LLaMA-1|2|3, Mistral, and OPT models.

A major challenge in adopting a more individualized approach to LLM alignment is its lack of scalability, as it involves repeatedly acquiring preference data and training new reward models and LLMs for each individual’s preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm where users specify what they value most within the system message, steering the LLM’s generation behavior to better align with the user’s intentions. However, a naive application of such an approach is non-trivial since LLMs are typically trained on a uniform system message (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant”), which limits\\ntheir ability to generalize to diverse, unseen system messages. To improve this generalization, we create Multifaceted Collection, augmenting 66k user instructions into 197k system messages through hierarchical user value combinations. Using this dataset, we train a 7B LLM called Janus and test it on 921 prompts from 5 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0, FLASK, Koala, MT-Bench, and Self-Instruct)\\nby adding system messages that reflect unseen user values.

This is achieved through MIDGArD's modular approach that separates the problem into two primary components: structure generation and shape generation. The structure generation module of MIDGArD aims at producing coherent articulation features from noisy or incomplete inputs. It acts on the object's structural and kinematic attributes, represented as features of a graph that are being progressively denoised to issue coherent and interpretable articulation solutions. This denoised graph then serves as an advanced conditioning mechanism for the shape generation module, a 3D generative model that populates each link of the articulated structure with consistent 3D meshes. Experiments show the superiority of MIDGArD on the quality, consistency, and interpretability of the generated assets.

Although several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, their internal decision-making tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood. This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics theories, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs. With a multiple-choice-list experiment, we initially estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities, but there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs. Further, we explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features of human beings, uncovering significant disparities across various demographic characteristics.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'interpretability_and_explainability'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/cfdb54076307baf1e330d87ecd09915bc38f9cff.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/d617cc2ce5b176fb5e7343d332d8b224e16f42e1.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\njia2024decisionmaking,\\ntitle={Decision-Making Behavior Evaluation Framework for {LLM}s under Uncertain Context},\\nauthor={Jingru Jia and Zehua Yuan and Junhao Pan and Paul E McNamara and Deming Chen},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=re0ly2Ylcu}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'jia|decisionmaking_behavior_evaluation_framework_for_llms_under_uncertain_context'}},forum = 're0ly2Ylcu',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7332/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7332/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7332/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7332/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Mainstream methods adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-modal trajectories. While straightforward and effective, the absence of detailed representation of future trajectories may yield suboptimal outcomes, given that the agent states dynamically evolve over time. To address this problem, we introduce DeMo, a framework that decouples multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries capturing distinct directional intentions and state queries tracking the agent's dynamic states over time. By leveraging this format, we separately optimize the multi-modality and dynamic evolutionary properties of trajectories. Subsequently, the mode and state queries are integrated to obtain a comprehensive and detailed representation of the trajectories. To achieve these operations, we additionally introduce combined Attention and Mamba techniques for global information aggregation and state sequence modeling, leveraging their respective strengths.

Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight conditional score-based model designed with 3D spatial awareness at its core. We demonstrate that by focusing on spatial attributes of objects, a single trained DeBaRA model can be leveraged at test time to perform several downstream applications such as scene synthesis, completion and re-arrangement.

We investigate end-to-end generative optimization – using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization.

We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method, RoAd, which employs a straightforward 2D rotation to adapt LLMs and addresses all the above challenges: (1) RoAd is remarkably parameter-efficient, delivering optimal performance on GLUE, eight commonsense reasoning tasks and four arithmetic reasoning tasks with <0.1% trainable parameters; (2) RoAd facilitates the efficient serving of requests requiring different adapters within a batch, with an overhead comparable to element-wise multiplication instead of batch matrix multiplication; (3) RoAd enhances LLM's interpretability through integration within a framework of distributed interchange intervention, demonstrated via composition experiments.\"}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/5fe855220b9d0e4d60e69355553d93656f841300.pdf'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'deep_learning_architectures'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nliao2024in,\\ntitle={3-in-1: 2D Rotary Adaptation for Efficient Finetuning, Efficient Batching and Composability},\\nauthor={Baohao Liao and Christof Monz},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rYjYwuM6yH}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'liao|3in1_2d_rotary_adaptation_for_efficient_finetuning_efficient_batching_and_composability'}},forum = 'rYjYwuM6yH',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19890/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19890/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19890/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19890/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Despite advances in robust offline reinforcement learning (RL), existing methods struggle to learn robust agents under high uncertainty caused by the diverse corrupted data (i.e., corrupted states, actions, rewards, and dynamics), leading to performance degradation in clean environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel robust variational Bayesian inference for offline RL (TRACER). It introduces Bayesian inference for the first time to capture the uncertainty via offline data for robustness against all types of data corruptions. Specifically, TRACER first models all corruptions as the uncertainty in the action-value function. Then, to capture such uncertainty, it uses all offline data as the observations to approximate the posterior distribution of the action-value function under a Bayesian inference framework. An appealing feature of TRACER is that it can distinguish corrupted data from clean data using an entropy-based uncertainty measure, since corrupted data often induces higher uncertainty and entropy. Based on the aforementioned measure, TRACER can regulate the loss associated with corrupted data to reduce its influence, thereby enhancing robustness and performance in clean environments. Experiments demonstrate that TRACER significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches across both individual and simultaneous data corruptions.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'reinforcement_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/c5cf320e1eaf394d53aa48fa1e90e081eb9c16eb.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nyang2024uncertaintybased,\\ntitle={Uncertainty-based Offline Variational Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for Robustness under Diverse Data Corruptions},\\nauthor={Rui Yang and Jie Wang and Guoping Wu and Bin Li},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=rTxCIWsfsD}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'yang|uncertaintybased_offline_variational_bayesian_reinforcement_learning_for_robustness_under_diverse_data_corruptions'}},forum = 'rTxCIWsfsD',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16300/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16300/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16300/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission16300/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in neural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered arrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take into account the weight scaling symmetries of $\\\\operatorname{ReLU}$ networks, and the weight sign flipping symmetries of $\\\\operatorname{sin}$ or $\\\\operatorname{Tanh}$ networks. In this paper, we extend the study of the group action on the network weights from the group of permutation matrices to the group of monomial matrices by incorporating scaling/sign-flipping symmetries. Particularly, we encode these scaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our corresponding equivariant and invariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs the Monomial Matrix Group Equivariant Neural Functional Networks (Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion of the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has much fewer independent trainable parameters compared to the baseline NFNs in the literature, thus enhancing the model's efficiency. Moreover, for fully connected and convolutional neural networks, we theoretically prove that all groups that leave these networks invariant while acting on their weight spaces are some subgroups of the monomial matrix group. We provide empirical evidences to demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing baselines, achieving competitive performance and efficiency.

This work highlights the problem and investigates it from a new perspective: distortion of query-key embedding space. Based on the statistical analysis, we reveal that queries and keys are mapped in completely different spaces while only a few keys are blended into the query region.

Concretely, we present an auxiliary loss that aligns queries and keys, preventing the distortion of query-key space and encouraging the model to find global relations by self-attention.

In these methods, an input view is geometrically warped to novel views with estimated depth maps, then the warped image is inpainted by T2I models. However, they struggle with noisy depth maps and loss of semantic details when warping an input view to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for single-shot novel view synthesis, a semantic-preserving generative warping framework that enables T2I generative models to learn where to warp and where to generate, through augmenting cross-view attention with self-attention. Our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by conditioning the generative model on source view images and incorporating geometric warping signals. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce *episodic future thinking (EFT) mechanism* for a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, inspired by the cognitive processes observed in animals. To enable future thinking functionality, we first develop a *multi-character policy* that captures diverse characters with an ensemble of heterogeneous policies. The *character* of an agent is defined as a different weight combination on reward components, representing distinct behavioral preferences. The future thinking agent collects observation-action trajectories of the target agents and leverages the pre-trained multi-character policy to infer their characters. Once the character is inferred, the agent predicts the upcoming actions of target agents and simulates the potential future scenario. This capability allows the agent to adaptively select the optimal action, considering the predicted future scenario in multi-agent scenarios. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, we consider the multi-agent autonomous driving scenario in which autonomous vehicles with different driving traits are on the road. Simulation results demonstrate that the EFT mechanism with accurate character inference leads to a higher reward than existing multi-agent solutions.

Successor Features (SFs) offer a potential solution to this challenge. However, canonical techniques for learning SFs from pixel-level observations often lead to representation collapse, wherein representations degenerate and fail to capture meaningful variations in the data. More recent methods for learning SFs can avoid representation collapse, but they often involve complex losses and multiple learning phases, reducing their efficiency. We introduce a novel, simple method for learning SFs directly from pixels. Our approach uses a combination of a Temporal-difference (TD) loss and a reward prediction loss, which together capture the basic mathematical definition of SFs.

This approach simultaneously achieves high accuracy and low resource consumption. Extensive experiments on bench mark datasets demonstrate F-OAL’s robust performance in OCIL scenarios.

However, the domain mismatch between the pre-training and the downstream CL tasks calls for finetuning of the CLIP on the latter.

Cooperating with the diverse range of existing prompting methods, CLAP can surpass the predominant deterministic finetuning approaches for CL with CLIP.

The most commonly used approach, weight decay, applies a constant penalty coefficient uniformly across all parameters.

To address this, we present Constrained Parameter Regularization (CPR) as an alternative to traditional weight decay. Unlike the uniform application of a single penalty, CPR enforces an upper bound on a statistical measure, such as the L$_2$-norm, of individual parameter matrices. Consequently, learning becomes a constraint optimization problem, which we tackle using an adaptation of the augmented Lagrangian method. CPR introduces only a minor runtime overhead and only requires setting an upper bound. We propose simple yet efficient mechanisms for initializing this bound, making CPR rely on no hyperparameter or one, akin to weight decay. Our empirical studies on computer vision and language modeling tasks demonstrate CPR's effectiveness. The results show that CPR can outperform traditional weight decay and increase performance in pre-training and fine-tuning.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'optimization_for_deep_networks'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/550c636f174d72a8593d652148fdb97d6944ae3e.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/75db04187cacdcbf868816c6448356c494636797.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nfranke2024improving,\\ntitle={Improving Deep Learning Optimization through Constrained Parameter Regularization},\\nauthor={J{\\\\\"o}rg K.H.

Differentially private (DP) training prevents the leakage of sensitive information in the collected training data from the trained machine learning models. DP optimizers, including DP stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and its variants, privatize the training procedure by gradient clipping and *DP noise* injection. However, in practice, DP models trained using DPSGD and its variants often suffer from significant model performance degradation. Such degradation prevents the application of DP optimization in many key tasks, such as foundation model pretraining. In this paper, we provide a novel *signal processing perspective* to the design and analysis of DP optimizers. We show that a ''frequency domain'' operation called *low-pass filtering* can be used to effectively reduce the impact of DP noise.  More specifically, by defining the ''frequency domain'' for both the gradient and differential privacy (DP) noise, we have developed a new component, called DOPPLER. This component is designed for DP algorithms and works by effectively amplifying the gradient while suppressing DP noise within this frequency domain. As a result, it maintains privacy guarantees and enhances the quality of the DP-protected model. Our experiments show that the proposed DP optimizers with a low-pass filter outperform their counterparts without the filter on various models and datasets. Both theoretical and practical evidence suggest that the  DOPPLER is effective in closing the gap between DP and non-DP training.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'privacy'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/f55eefb1a27c15148c2b579611582a133f6f2a1f.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/5f180602df6994b271c40afca495805423da0bad.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nzhang2024doppler,\\ntitle={{DOPPLER}: Differentially Private Optimizers with Low-pass Filter for Privacy Noise Reduction},\\nauthor={Xinwei Zhang and Zhiqi Bu and Mingyi Hong and Meisam Razaviyayn},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=r8YntmAd0g}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'zhang|doppler_differentially_private_optimizers_with_lowpass_filter_for_privacy_noise_reduction'}},forum = 'r8YntmAd0g',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8468/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8468/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8468/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8468/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

These datasets are created by randomly concatenating documents of various lengths and then chunking them into sequences of a predetermined target length (concat-and-chunk). Recent attention implementations mask cross-document attention, reducing the effective length of a chunk of tokens. Additionally, training on long sequences becomes computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of attention. In this study, we introduce dataset decomposition, a novel variable sequence length training technique, to tackle these challenges. We decompose a dataset into a union of buckets, each containing sequences of the same size extracted from a unique document. During training, we use variable sequence length and batch-size, sampling simultaneously from all buckets with a curriculum. In contrast to the concat-and-chunk baseline, which incurs a fixed attention cost at every step of training, our proposed method incurs a computational cost proportional to the actual document lengths at each step, resulting in significant savings in training time. We train an 8k context-length 1B model at the same cost as a 2k context-length model trained with the baseline approach.

Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their global receptive field and linear complexity with respect to the input length, demonstrating substantial potential across fields including natural language processing and computer vision. To improve the performance of SSMs in vision tasks, a multi-scan strategy is widely adopted, which leads to significant redundancy of SSMs. For a better trade-off between efficiency and performance, we analyze the underlying reasons behind the success of the multi-scan strategy, where long-range dependency plays an important role. Based on the analysis, we introduce Multi-Scale Vision Mamba (MSVMamba) to preserve the superiority of SSMs in vision tasks with limited parameters. It employs a multi-scale 2D scanning technique on both original and downsampled feature maps, which not only benefits long-range dependency learning but also reduces computational costs. Additionally, we integrate a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) to address the lack of channel mixing.

To resolve these issues, we propose a method that seamlessly merge 3DGS with the learning of neural SDFs. Our key idea is to more effectively constrain the SDF inference with the multi-view consistency. To this end, we dynamically align 3D Gaussians on the zero-level set of the neural SDF, and then render the aligned 3D Gaussians through the differentiable rasterization. Meanwhile, we update the neural SDF by pulling neighboring space to the pulled 3D Gaussians, which progressively refine the signed distance field near the surface. With both differentiable pulling and splatting, we jointly optimize 3D Gaussians and the neural SDF with both RGB and geometry constraints, which recovers more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with more geometry details.

Extensive testing on the ScanRefer benchmark has shown that RG-SAN not only establishes new performance benchmarks, with an mIoU increase of 5.1 points, but also exhibits significant improvements in robustness when processing descriptions with spatial ambiguity.

This raises a challenging research question: How can we keep improving the systems when their capabilities have surpassed the levels of humans? This paper answers this question in the context of tackling hard reasoning tasks (e.g., level 4-5 MATH problems) via learning from human annotations on easier tasks (e.g., level 1-3 MATH problems), which we term as easy-to-hard generalization. Our key insight is that an evaluator (reward model) trained on supervisions for easier tasks can be effectively used for scoring candidate solutions of harder tasks and hence facilitating easy-to-hard generalization over different levels of tasks. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach to scalable alignment, which firstly trains the (process-supervised) reward models on easy problems (e.g., level 1-3), and then uses them to evaluate the performance of policy models on hard problems. We show that such easy-to-hard generalization from evaluators can enable easy-to-hard generalizations in generators either through re-ranking or reinforcement learning (RL). Notably, our process-supervised 7b RL model and 34b model (reranking@1024) achieves an accuracy of 34.0% and 52.5% on MATH500, respectively, despite only using human supervision on easy problems.

Three main data selection approaches are: (1) leveraging external non-CLIP models to aid data selection, (2) training new CLIP-style embedding models that are more effective at selecting high-quality data than the original OpenAI CLIP model, and (3) designing better metrics or strategies universally applicable to any CLIP embedding without requiring specific model properties (e.g., CLIPScore is one popular metric).  While the first two approaches have been extensively studied, the third remains under-explored. In this paper, we advance the third approach by proposing two new methods. Firstly, instead of classical CLIP scores that only consider the alignment between two modalities from a single sample, we introduce $\\\\textbf{negCLIPLoss}$,  a method inspired by CLIP training loss that adds the alignment between one sample and its contrastive pairs as an extra normalization term to CLIPScore for better quality measurement. Secondly, when downstream tasks are known, we propose a new norm-based metric, $\\\\textbf{NormSim}$, to measure the similarity between pretraining data and target data.

This paper introduces a novel task, called Time Series Editing (TSE), to synthesize time series by manipulating existing time series. The objective is to modify the given time series according to the specified attributes while preserving other properties unchanged. This task is not trivial due to the inadequacy of data coverage and the intricate relationships between time series and their attributes. To address these issues, we introduce a novel diffusion model, called TEdit. The proposed TEdit is trained using a novel bootstrap learning algorithm that effectively enhances the coverage of the original data. It is also equipped with an innovative multi-resolution modeling and generation paradigm to capture the complex relationships between time series and their attributes.

Advances in end-to-end rPPG approaches have focused on this transformation where attention mechanisms are crucial for feature extraction. However, existing methods compute attention disjointly across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions. Here, we propose the Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM), which jointly computes multidimensional attention from voxel embeddings using nonnegative matrix factorization. To demonstrate FSAM's effectiveness, we developed FactorizePhys, an end-to-end 3D-CNN architecture for estimating blood volume pulse signals from raw video frames. Our approach adeptly factorizes voxel embeddings to achieve comprehensive spatial, temporal, and channel attention, enhancing performance of generic signal extraction tasks. Furthermore, we deploy FSAM within an existing 2D-CNN-based rPPG architecture to illustrate its versatility. FSAM and FactorizePhys are thoroughly evaluated against state-of-the-art rPPG methods, each representing different types of architecture and attention mechanism. We perform ablation studies to investigate the architectural decisions and hyperparameters of FSAM. Experiments on four publicly available datasets and intuitive visualization of learned spatial-temporal features substantiate the effectiveness of FSAM and enhanced cross-dataset generalization in estimating rPPG signals, suggesting its broader potential as a multidimensional attention mechanism.

In this paper, we theorize that enhancing performance requires expanding the semantic pool, while increasing the expected probability of selected OOD labels being activated by OOD samples, and ensuring low mutual dependence among the activations of these OOD labels. A natural expansion manner is to adopt a larger lexicon; however, the inevitable introduction of numerous synonyms and uncommon words fails to meet the above requirements, indicating that viable expansion manners move beyond merely selecting words from a lexicon. Since OOD detection aims to correctly classify input images into ID/OOD class groups, we can \"make up\" OOD label candidates which are not standard class names but beneficial for the process. Observing that the original semantic pool is comprised of unmodified specific class names, we correspondingly construct a conjugated semantic pool (CSP) consisting of modified superclass names, each serving as a cluster center for samples sharing similar properties across different categories. Consistent with our established theory, expanding OOD label candidates with the CSP satisfies the requirements and outperforms existing works by 7.89% in FPR95.

However, the learning pipeline in 3DGS inherently lacks the ability to quantify uncertainty, which is an important factor in applications like robotics mapping and navigation. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty estimation method built upon the Bayesian inference framework. Specifically, we propose a method to build variational multi-scale 3D Gaussians, where we leverage explicit scale information in 3DGS parameters to construct diversified parameter space samples. We develop an offset table technique to draw local multi-scale samples efficiently by offsetting selected attributes and sharing other base attributes. Then, the offset table is learned by variational inference with multi-scale prior. The learned offset posterior can quantify the uncertainty of each individual Gaussian component, and be used in the forward pass to infer the predictive uncertainty. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed method provides well-aligned calibration performance on estimated uncertainty and better rendering quality compared with the previous methods that enable uncertainty quantification with view synthesis. Besides, by leveraging the model parameter uncertainty estimated by our method, we can remove noisy Gaussians automatically, thereby obtaining a high-fidelity part of the reconstructed scene, which is of great help in improving the visual quality.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/04908a881d0fb5acac0e7f69d6515e2116793e6e.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nli2024variational,\\ntitle={Variational Multi-scale Representation for Estimating Uncertainty in 3D Gaussian Splatting},\\nauthor={Ruiqi Li and Yiu-ming Cheung},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=qpeAtfUWOQ}\\n}'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/0510d95a78e5b2f2187c06e66cb604c5fe9c7164.zip'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'li|variational_multiscale_representation_for_estimating_uncertainty_in_3d_gaussian_splatting'}},forum = 'qpeAtfUWOQ',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission15780/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission15780/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission15780/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission15780/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

With the rise of Language Models (LMs), LM-based recommenders have been widely explored due to their extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning abilities. Most of the LM-based recommenders convert historical interactions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target response and fine-tuning LM with a language modeling loss. However, the current objective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for personalized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of LM-based recommenders. Inspired by the current advancement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax loss in recommendations, we propose Softmax-DPO (\\\\textbf{S-DPO}) to instill ranking information into the LM to help LM-based recommenders distinguish preferred items from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives. Specifically, we incorporate multiple negatives in user preference data and devise an alternative version of DPO loss tailored for LM-based recommenders, which is extended from the traditional full-ranking Plackett-Luce (PL) model to partial rankings and connected to softmax sampling strategies. Theoretically, we bridge S-DPO with the softmax loss over negative sampling and find that it has an inherent benefit of mining hard negatives, which assures its exceptional capabilities in recommendation tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of S-DPO to effectively model user preference and further boost recommendation performance while providing better rewards for preferred items.

In this paper, we propose SocraticLM, which achieves a Socratic \"Thought-Provoking\" teaching paradigm that fulfills the role of a real classroom teacher in actively engaging students in the thought process required for genuine problem-solving mastery. To build SocraticLM, we first propose a novel \"Dean-Teacher-Student\" multi-agent pipeline to construct a new dataset, SocraTeach, which contains $35$K meticulously crafted Socratic-style multi-round (equivalent to $208$K single-round) teaching dialogues grounded in fundamental mathematical problems. Our dataset simulates authentic teaching scenarios, interacting with six representative types of simulated students with different cognitive states, and strengthening four crucial teaching abilities. SocraticLM is then fine-tuned on SocraTeach with three strategies balancing its teaching and reasoning abilities. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive evaluation system encompassing five pedagogical dimensions for assessing the teaching quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments verify that SocraticLM achieves significant improvements in the teaching performance, outperforming GPT4 by more than 12\\\\%.

This is a generalization of the channel simulation problem, which has recently found applications and achieved state of the art results in realistic image compression, neural network compression, and communication-efficient federated learning. In this problem, the transmitter wants the receiver to generate multiple independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a target distribution $P$, while the transmitter and the receiver have access to independent samples from a reference distribution $Q$. The core idea is to employ channel simulation in multiple rounds while updating the reference distribution $Q$ after each round in order to reduce the KL-divergence between $P$ and $Q$, thereby reducing the communication cost in subsequent rounds. We derive a lower bound on the expected communication cost and construct a practical algorithm that achieves the lower bound up to a multiplicative constant. We then employ this algorithm in communication-efficient federated learning, in which model updates correspond to samples from a distribution, and achieve a 37% reduction in the communication load.

To address these security vulnerabilities, various backdoor purification methods have been proposed to purify compromised models. Typically, these purified models exhibit low Attack Success Rates (ASR), rendering them resistant to backdoored inputs. However, \\\\textit{Does achieving a low ASR through current safety purification methods truly eliminate learned backdoor features from the pretraining phase?} In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by thoroughly investigating the \\\\textit{Post-Purification Robustness} of current backdoor purification methods. We find that current safety purification methods are vulnerable to the rapid re-learning of backdoor behavior, even when further fine-tuning of purified models is performed using a very small number of poisoned samples. Based on this, we further propose the practical Query-based Reactivation Attack (QRA) which could effectively reactivate the backdoor by merely querying purified models. We find the failure to achieve satisfactory post-purification robustness stems from the insufficient deviation of purified models from the backdoored model along the backdoor-connected path. To improve the post-purification robustness, we propose a straightforward tuning defense, Path-Aware Minimization (PAM), which promotes deviation along backdoor-connected paths with extra model updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAM significantly improves post-purification robustness while maintaining a good clean accuracy and low ASR.

However, existing retargeting methods often struggle to balance the preservation of key semantics and image quality, resulting in either deformation or loss of important objects, or the introduction of local artifacts such as discontinuous pixels and inconsistent regenerated content. To address these issues, we propose a content-aware retargeting method called PruneRepaint. It incorporates semantic importance for each pixel to guide the identification of regions that need to be pruned or preserved in order to maintain key semantics. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive repainting module that selects image regions for repainting based on the distribution of pruned pixels and the proportion between foreground size and target aspect ratio, thus achieving local smoothness after pruning. By focusing on the content and structure of the foreground, our PruneRepaint approach adaptively avoids key content loss and deformation, while effectively mitigating artifacts with local repainting. We conduct experiments on the public RetargetMe benchmark and demonstrate through objective experimental results and subjective user studies that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of preserving semantics and aesthetics, as well as better generalization across diverse aspect ratios.

This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\\\\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis.

The development of large foundation models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) motivates us to explore a feasible solution to empower VI-ReID with off-the-shelf large foundation models. To this end, we propose a novel Text-enhanced VI-ReID framework driven by Large Foundation Models (TVI-LFM). The core idea is to enrich the representation of the infrared modality with textual descriptions automatically generated by VLMs. Specifically, we incorporate a pre-trained VLM to extract textual features from texts generated by VLM and augmented by LLM, and incrementally fine-tune the text encoder to minimize the domain gap between generated texts and original visual modalities. Meanwhile, to enhance the infrared modality with extracted textual representations, we leverage modality alignment capabilities of VLMs and VLM-generated feature-level filters. This enables the text model to learn complementary features from the infrared modality, ensuring the semantic structural consistency between the fusion modality and the visible modality.

Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively.

Knowledge distillation, which leverages data representation and pair-wise similarity, has shown significant potential in preserving information in SSCL. However, traditional distillation strategies often fail in unlabeled data with inaccurate or noisy information, limiting their efficiency in feature spaces undergoing substantial changes during continual learning. To address these limitations, we propose Persistence Homology Distillation (PsHD) to preserve intrinsic structural information that is insensitive to noise in semi-supervised continual learning. First, we capture the structural features using persistence homology by homological evolution across different scales in vision data, where the multi-scale characteristic established its stability under noise interference. Next, we propose a persistence homology distillation loss in SSCL and design an acceleration algorithm to reduce the computational cost of persistence homology in our module.

However, collecting sufficient data for expert knowledge is always difficult. To handle this problem, Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) has been proposed to transfer the source-domain knowledge learned from sufficient data to target domains where only scarce data is available. In this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon neglected by previous works for the CDFSL task based on ViT: leaving the CLS token to random initialization, instead of loading source-domain trained parameters, could consistently improve target-domain performance. We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find **the CLS token naturally absorbs domain information** due to the inherent structure of the ViT, which is represented as the low-frequency component in the Fourier frequency space of images. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a method for the CDFSL task to decouple the domain information in the CLS token during the source-domain training, and adapt the CLS token on the target domain for efficient few-shot learning.

Designing its private analogue poses two difficulties. First, our DP algorithm can not resample new datapoints as a change to a single datapoint may lead to a very large change in the descretization of the real line. In contrast, the (sorted) index of the discretization point changes only by $1$ between neighboring instances, and so we use a novel algorithm that set the discretization points using random Bernoulli noise, resulting in only a few buckets being affected under the right coupling. Second, our algorithm, which doesn't resample data, requires we also revisit the utility analysis of the original algorithm and prove its correctness w.r.t. the original sorted data; a problem we tackle using sampling a subset of Poisson-drawn size from each discretized bin.

Our theoretical insights show that a single metric (a measure of the intrinsic dimension of the model's features) can be used to assess a model's editability and reveals its previously unrecognised susceptibility to malicious *stealth attacks*. This metric is fundamental to predicting the success of a variety of editing approaches, and reveals new bridges between disparate families of editing methods. We collectively refer to these as *stealth editing* methods, because they directly update a model's weights to specify its response to specific known hallucinating prompts without affecting other model behaviour. By carefully applying our theoretical insights, we are able to introduce a new *jet-pack* network block which is optimised for highly selective model editing, uses only standard network operations, and can be inserted into existing networks. We also reveal the vulnerability of language models to stealth attacks: a small change to a model's weights which fixes its response to a single attacker-chosen prompt. Stealth attacks are computationally simple, do not require access to or knowledge of the model's training data, and therefore represent a potent yet previously unrecognised threat to redistributed foundation models.

Besides, they typically face difficulties in aligning the cross-die modules in 3D ICs due to their heuristic representations, which could potentially result in severe data transfer failures. To address these issues, we propose FlexPlanner, a flexible learning-based method in hybrid action space with multi-modality representation to simultaneously handle position, aspect ratio, and alignment of blocks. To our best knowledge, FlexPlanner is the first learning-based approach to discard heuristic-based search in the 3D FP task. Thus, the solution space is not limited by the heuristic floorplanning representation, allowing for significant improvements in both wirelength and alignment scores. Specifically, FlexPlanner models 3D FP based on multi-modalities, including vision, graph, and sequence. To address the non-trivial heuristic-dependent issue, we design a sophisticated policy network with hybrid action space and asynchronous layer decision mechanism that allow for determining the versatile properties of each block. Experiments on public benchmarks MCNC and GSRC show the effectiveness. We significantly improve the alignment score from 0.474 to 0.940 and achieve an average reduction of 16% in wirelength.

In standard fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, the learning algorithm controls *all* agents in the scenario, while in ad hoc teamwork, the learning algorithm usually assumes control over only a *single* agent in the scenario.

For example, in an autonomous driving scenario,  a company might train its cars with the same learning algorithm, yet once on the road, these cars must cooperate with cars from another company. Towards expanding the class of scenarios that cooperative learning methods may optimally address, we introduce $N$*-agent ad hoc teamwork* (NAHT), where a set of autonomous agents must interact and cooperate with dynamically varying numbers and types of teammates. This paper formalizes the problem, and proposes the *Policy Optimization with Agent Modelling* (POAM) algorithm. POAM is a policy gradient, multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to the NAHT problem, that enables adaptation to diverse teammate behaviors by learning representations of teammate behaviors. Empirical evaluation on tasks from the multi-agent particle environment and StarCraft II shows that POAM improves cooperative task returns compared to baseline approaches, and enables out-of-distribution generalization to unseen teammates.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'reinforcement_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/b2a493d4f38a4116108b0ba02a974d3b686c5421.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nwang2024nagent,\\ntitle={N-agent Ad Hoc Teamwork},\\nauthor={Caroline Wang and Arrasy Rahman and Ishan Durugkar and Elad Liebman and Peter Stone},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=q7TxGUWlhD}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'wang|nagent_ad_hoc_teamwork'}},forum = 'q7TxGUWlhD',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13850/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13850/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13850/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission13850/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY-NC 4.0'),\n",

While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively. To enhance LLM’s cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization. Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements. By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures. Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including a series of auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval). Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization. In particular, we boost the open-sourced LLaMA2-70B model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the halluci- nation evaluator.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images (``winner'' and ``loser'' images) for each text prompt.\\nIn this paper, we introduce an innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-Diffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process. Our approach offers an alternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly improving both model performance and alignment. Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration.

However, in this paper, we observed a phenomenon that such a fixed prior would lead to a low probability of sampling actual private data during the inversion process due to the inherent distribution gap between the prior distribution and the private data distribution, thereby constraining attack performance. To address this limitation, we propose increasing the density around high-quality pseudo-private data—recovered samples through model inversion that exhibit characteristics of the private training data—by slightly tuning the generator. This strategy effectively increases the probability of sampling actual private data that is close to these pseudo-private data during the inversion process.

To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel CKL approach termed Train-Attention-Augmented Language Model (TAALM), which enhances learning efficiency by dynamically predicting and applying weights to tokens based on their usefulness. This method employs a meta-learning framework that optimizes token importance predictions, facilitating targeted knowledge updates and minimizing forgetting. Also, we observe that existing benchmarks do not clearly exhibit the trade-off between learning and retaining, therefore we propose a new benchmark, LAMA-ckl, to address this issue.

By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models.

Meanwhile, this robust pattern can be obtained from an `observation' window located at the end of the prompts. Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by selecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head. Our approach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory footprint when processing long input sequences. Specifically, SnapKV achieves a consistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x enhancement in memory efficiency compared to baseline when processing inputs of 16K tokens. At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets. Moreover, SnapKV can process up to 380K context tokens on a single A100-80GB GPU using HuggingFace implementation with minor changes, exhibiting only a negligible accuracy drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test.

In the classical RLHF framework, a reward model is first trained to represent human preferences, which is in turn used by an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimized the LLM. A prominent issue with such methods is reward over-optimization or reward hacking, where the performance as measured by the learned proxy reward model increases, but the true model quality plateaus or even deteriorates. Direct Alignment Algorithms (DDAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the classical RLHF pipeline. However, despite not training a separate proxy reward model or using RL, they still commonly deteriorate from over-optimization. While the so-called reward hacking phenomenon is not well-defined for DAAs, we still uncover similar trends: at higher KL-budgets, DAA algorithms exhibit similar degradation patters to their classic RLHF counterparts. In particular, we find that DAA methods deteriorate not only across a wide range of KL-budgets, but also often before even a single epoch of the dataset is completed. Through extensive empirical experimentation this work formulates the reward over-optimization or hacking problem for DAAs and explores its consequences across objectives, training regimes, and model scales.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'natural_language_processing'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/e28365fb2dd2a9b94f8225bee790989091ef456f.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/a328dc0d62a6e5c792f1e0aca02f183839ead34d.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nrafailov2024scaling,\\ntitle={Scaling Laws for Reward Model Overoptimization in Direct Alignment Algorithms},\\nauthor={Rafael Rafailov and Yaswanth Chittepu and Ryan Park and Harshit Sikchi and Joey Hejna and W.

Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.

Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding. We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of 100M long caption oriented text-image pairs. It is noteworthy that, on the task of long-text image retrieval, we beat the competitor using long captions with 11.1% improvement (i.e., from 72.62% to 83.72%).

Event-based sensors, which could capture changes in the scene with exceptional temporal granularity, may potentially offer a unique opportunity to predict future motion with a level of detail and precision previously unachievable. Inspired by that, we propose to integrate the strong learning capacity of the video diffusion model with the rich motion information of an event camera as a motion simulation framework. Specifically, we initially employ pre-trained stable video diffusion models to adapt the event sequence dataset.

Moreover, we introduce an alignment mechanism that utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the reverse generation trajectory of the diffusion model, ensuring improved performance and accuracy. Through extensive testing and validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various complex scenarios, showcasing its potential to revolutionize motion flow prediction in computer vision applications such as autonomous vehicle guidance, robotic navigation, and interactive media.

However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to the vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM individually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics shared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of recent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to generate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs are trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher estimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are easily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human preference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training schemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely (i) continual preference fine-tuning to make reward model prefer aligned LGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a rephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a median preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the decision boundary better.

Our findings reveal that the dynamics of standard SAM effectively reduce to applying SAM solely in the last layer in wide neural networks, even with optimal hyperparameters. In contrast, we identify a stable parameterization with layerwise perturbation scaling, which we call *Maximal Update and Perturbation Parameterization* ($\\\\mu$P$^2$), that ensures all layers are both feature learning and effectively perturbed in the limit.

Quantization has emerged as an effective technique for KV cache compression, but existing methods still fail at very low bit widths. Currently, KV cache quantization is performed per-channel or per-token independently. Our analysis shows that distinct channels of a key/value activation embedding are highly interdependent, and the joint entropy of multiple channels grows at a slower rate than the sum of their marginal entropy, which implies that per-channel independent quantization is sub-optimal. To mitigate this sub-optimality, we propose Coupled Quantization (CQ), which couples multiple key/value channels together for quantization to exploit their interdependence and encode the activations in a more information-efficient manner. Extensive experiments reveal that CQ compares favorably with existing baselines in preserving model quality, and improves inference throughput by 1.4–3.5$\\\\times$ relative to the uncompressed baseline.

In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively.

We call the phenomenon the implicit invariance learning. Specifically, we theoretically investigate the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent model learning spurious signals.

In this framework, the final inference speed is decided by the decoding speed of the draft model and the acceptance rate of the draft provided by the draft model. Currently the widely used draft models usually generate draft tokens for the next several positions in a non-autoregressive way without considering the correlations between draft tokens.

This token-adaptive approach boosts the representational power of binarized LLMs by enabling contextual adjustments to the values of binary weights.

In contrast to the online setting, only using static datasets poses additional challenges, such as policies generating out-of-distribution samples. Model-based offline reinforcement learning methods try to overcome these by learning a model of the underlying dynamics of the environment and using it to guide policy search. It is beneficial but, with limited datasets, errors in the model and the issue of value overestimation among out-of-distribution states can worsen performance. Current model-based methods apply some notion of conservatism to the Bellman update, often implemented using uncertainty estimation derived from model ensembles. In this paper, we propose Constrained Latent Action Policies (C-LAP) which learns a generative model of the joint distribution of observations and actions. We cast policy learning as a constrained objective to always stay within the support of the latent action distribution, and use the generative capabilities of the model to impose an implicit constraint on the generated actions. Thereby eliminating the need to use additional uncertainty penalties on the Bellman update and significantly decreasing the number of gradient steps required to learn a policy.

Existing SOTA methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and uses 88.5\\\\% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global and local features to improve performance.

Recently, a series of studies attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying CoT, aiming to deepen the understanding of its efficacy. Nevertheless, the existing research faces two major challenges: (1) a lack of quantitative metrics to assess CoT capabilities and (2) a dearth of guidance on optimizing CoT performance. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce a novel reasoning boundary framework (RBF) to address these challenges. To solve the lack of quantification, we first define a reasoning boundary (RB) to quantify the upper-bound of CoT and establish a combination law for RB, enabling a practical quantitative approach applicable to various real-world CoT tasks. To address the lack of optimization, we propose three categories of RBs. We further optimize these categories with combination laws focused on RB promotion and reasoning path optimization for CoT improvement. Through extensive experiments on 27 models and 5 tasks, the study validates the existence and rationality of the proposed framework. Furthermore, it explains the effectiveness of 10 CoT strategies and guides optimization from two perspectives.

Until now, no tabular method has consistently outperformed classical supervised learning, which ignores these shifts. To address temporal distribution shifts, we present Drift-Resilient TabPFN, a fresh approach based on In-Context Learning with a Prior-Data Fitted Network that learns the learning algorithm itself: it accepts the entire training dataset as input and makes predictions on the test set in a single forward pass. Specifically, it learns to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from a prior that specifies the model's inductive bias. This prior is based on structural causal models (SCM), which gradually shift over time. To model shifts of these causal models, we use a secondary SCM, that specifies changes in the primary model parameters. The resulting Drift-Resilient TabPFN can be applied to unseen data, runs in seconds on small to moderately sized datasets and needs no hyperparameter tuning.

However, the generalization properties of second-order methods are still being debated. Theoretical investigations have proved difficult to carry out outside the tractable settings of heavily simplified model classes - thus, the relevance of existing theories to practical deep learning applications remains unclear. Similarly, empirical studies in large-scale models and real datasets are significantly confounded by the necessity to approximate second-order updates in practice. It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour arises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or instead reflects the specific structured (e.g. Kronecker) approximations used or any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates. Here, we show for the first time that exact Gauss-Newton (GN) updates take on a tractable form in a class of deep reversible architectures that are sufficiently expressive to be meaningfully applied to common benchmark datasets. We exploit this novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of the GN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly. In the mini-batch training setting, this manifests as rapidly saturating progress even on the training loss, with parameter updates found to overfit each mini-batch without producing the features that would support generalization to other mini-batches. In contrast to previous work, we show that our experiments run in the feature learning regime, in which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) changes during the course of training.

To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization in MLLMs, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector in MLLMs. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics.

By characterizing learning dynamics in this space, we identify how the speed at which a concept is learned, and hence the order of concept learning, is controlled by properties of the data we term concept signal. Further, we observe moments of sudden turns in the direction of a model’s learning dynamics in concept space. Surprisingly, these points precisely correspond to the emergence of hidden capabilities, i.e., where latent interventions show the model possesses the capability to manipulate a concept, but these capabilities cannot yet be elicited via naive input prompting. While our results focus on synthetically defined toy datasets, we hypothesize a general claim on emergence of hidden capabilities may hold: generative models possess latent capabilities that emerge suddenly and consistently during training, though a model might not exhibit these capabilities under naive input prompting.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'interpretability_and_explainability'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 spotlight'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/cd344c6f2d8a5970e4d4267156a7cfb867521da6.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\npark2024emergence,\\ntitle={Emergence of Hidden Capabilities: Exploring Learning Dynamics in Concept Space},\\nauthor={Core Francisco Park and Maya Okawa and Andrew Lee and Ekdeep Singh Lubana and Hidenori Tanaka},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=owuEcT6BTl}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'park|emergence_of_hidden_capabilities_exploring_learning_dynamics_in_concept_space'}},forum = 'owuEcT6BTl',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21435/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21435/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21435/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21435/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Preference-based evolutionary MO (PBEMO) has emerged as a promising framework that progressively approximates SOI by involving human in the optimization-cum-decision-making process. Yet, current PBEMO approaches are prone to be inefficient and misaligned with the DM’s true aspirations, especially when inadvertently exploiting mis-calibrated reward models. This is further exacerbated when considering the stochastic nature of human feedback. This paper proposes a novel framework that navigates MO to SOI by directly leveraging human feedback without being restricted by a predefined reward model nor cumbersome model selection. Specifically, we developed a clustering-based stochastic dueling bandits algorithm that strategically scales well to high-dimensional dueling bandits, and achieves a regret of $\\\\mathcal{O}(K^2\\\\log T)$, where $K$ is the number of clusters and $T$ is the number of rounds. The learned preferences are then transformed into a unified probabilistic format that can be readily adapted to prevalent EMO algorithms. This also leads to a principled termination criterion that strategically manages human cognitive loads and computational budget.

Large scale synthetic and object-centric 3D datasets have shown to be effective in training models that have 3D understanding of objects. However, applying a similar approach to real-world objects and scenes is difficult due to a lack of large-scale data. Videos are a potential source for real-world 3D data, but finding diverse yet corresponding views of the same content have shown to be difficult at scale. Furthermore, standard videos come with fixed viewpoints, determined at the time of capture. This restricts the ability to access scenes from a variety of more diverse and potentially useful perspectives. We argue that large scale ODIN videos can address these limitations to provide scalable corresponding frames from diverse views.  In this paper we introduce 360-1M, a 360° video dataset consisting of 1 million videos, and a process for efficiently finding corresponding frames from diverse viewpoints at scale. We train our diffusion-based model, ODIN, on 360-1M. Empowered by the largest real-world, multi-view dataset to date, ODIN is able to freely generate novel views of real-world scenes.

State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to {\\\\it simultaneously} build an reward model and a policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but are robust to the presence of low-quality supervised learning data. Moreover, we discover a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and a recent line of works called Self-Play Fine-tune (SPIN, \\\\cite{chen2024self}). Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches.

Local interneurons are thought to play an important role in these transformations, shaping patterns of circuit activity to facilitate and direct information flow. However, the relationship between these coordinated, nonlinear, circuit-level transformations and the properties of interneurons (e.g., connectivity, activation functions) remains unknown. Here, we propose a normative computational model that establishes such a relationship. Our model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit, which is comprised of primary neurons that are recurrently connected to a set of local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by dynamically adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons as well as the interneuron activation functions. In an application motivated by redundancy reduction theory, we demonstrate that when the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the circuit learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses. Overall, our results provide a framework in which the distribution of circuit responses is systematically and nonlinearly controlled by adjustment of interneuron connectivity and activation functions.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'neuroscience_and_cognitive_science'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/114269791aae20bc4e759430ce5081dcf812397f.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nlipshutz2024shaping,\\ntitle={Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model},\\nauthor={David Lipshutz and Eero P Simoncelli},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=ojLIEQ0j9T}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'lipshutz|shaping_the_distribution_of_neural_responses_with_interneurons_in_a_recurrent_circuit_model'}},forum = 'ojLIEQ0j9T',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6533/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6533/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6533/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission6533/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

At the same time, we discover the nature of general action completeness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over time. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can be shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary poses for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for capturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage as a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and linear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via clustering.

This paper points out two issues of the state-of-the-art GR models. (1) The pre-defined and fixed number of user groups is inadequate for real-time industrial recommendation systems, where the group distribution can shift dynamically. (2) The training schema of existing GR methods is supervised, necessitating expensive user-group and group-item labels, leading to significant annotation costs. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised group recommendation framework named $\\\\underline{\\\\text{I}}$dentify $\\\\underline{\\\\text{T}}$hen $\\\\underline{\\\\text{R}}$ecommend ($\\\\underline{\\\\text{ITR}}$), where it first identifies the user groups in an unsupervised manner even without the pre-defined number of groups, and then two pre-text tasks are designed to conduct self-supervised group recommendation. Concretely, at the group identification stage, we first estimate the adaptive density of each user point, where areas with higher densities are more likely to be recognized as group centers. Then, a heuristic merge-and-split strategy is designed to discover the user groups and decision boundaries. Subsequently, at the self-supervised learning stage, the pull-and-repulsion pre-text task is proposed to optimize the user-group distribution.

Recent advancements in DETR-based visual grounding methods have attracted considerable attention, as they directly predict the coordinates of the target object without relying on additional efforts, such as pre-generated proposal candidates or pre-defined anchor boxes. However, existing research primarily focuses on designing stronger multi-modal decoder, which typically generates learnable queries by random initialization or by using linguistic embeddings.  This vanilla query generation approach inevitably increases the learning difficulty for the model, as it does not involve any target-related information at the beginning of decoding. Furthermore, they only use the deepest image feature during the query learning process, overlooking the importance of features from other levels. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, called RefFormer. It consists of the query adaption module that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP and generate the referential query to provide the prior context for decoder, along with a task-specific decoder. By incorporating the referential query into the decoder, we can effectively mitigate the learning difficulty of the decoder, and accurately concentrate on the target object. Additionally, our proposed query adaption module can also act as an adapter, preserving the rich knowledge within CLIP without the need to tune the parameters of the backbone network.

However, a major challenge in achieving this goal is the observation that distillation approaches, which rely on sophisticated but mostly disparate methods to generate synthetic data, have little in common with each other. In this work, we highlight a largely overlooked aspect common to most of these methods: the use of soft (probabilistic) labels. Through a series of ablation experiments, we study the role of soft labels in depth. Our results reveal that the main factor explaining the performance of state-of-the-art distillation methods is not the specific techniques used to generate synthetic data but rather the use of soft labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that not all soft labels are created equal; they must contain *structured information* to be beneficial. We also provide empirical scaling laws that characterize the effectiveness of soft labels as a function of images-per-class in the distilled dataset and establish an empirical Pareto frontier for data-efficient learning. Combined, our findings challenge conventional wisdom in dataset distillation, underscore the importance of soft labels in learning, and suggest new directions for improving distillation methods.

However, due to the use of a pre-set fixed peak receptive field sampling rule, PKC still has limitations in dealing with problems such as inconsistency of target frequency domain response broadening, non-homogeneous and time-varying characteristic of noise/clutter distribution.

In the visual representation learning domain, our Soft TPR confers broad benefits over symbolic compositional representations: state-of-the-art disentanglement and improved representation learner convergence, along with enhanced sample efficiency and superior low-sample regime performance for downstream models, empirically affirming the value of our inherently *continuous* compositional representation learning framework.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/88f6722539807529826a419eb4454c1b1f67b7b1.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/ee3b9dd34eabcba5698f62767ca6e11b7e95e1a8.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nsun2024soft,\\ntitle={Soft Tensor Product Representations for Fully Continuous, Compositional Visual Representations},\\nauthor={Bethia Sun and Maurice Pagnucco and Yang Song},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=oEVsxVdush}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'sun|soft_tensor_product_representations_for_fully_continuous_compositional_visual_representations'}},forum = 'oEVsxVdush',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14814/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14814/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14814/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14814/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

The key idea of NeuralSteiner approach is to learn Steiner trees: we first predict the locations of highly likely Steiner points by adopting a neural network considering full-net spatial and overflow information, then select appropriate points by running a graph-based post-processing algorithm, and finally connect these points with the input pins to yield overflow-avoiding RSTs.

In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words.

However, in this paper, we find that these models tend to generate videos with less motion than expected. We attribute this to the issue called conditional image leakage, where the image-to-video diffusion models (I2V-DMs) tend to over-rely on the conditional image at large time steps. We further address this challenge from both inference and training aspects. First, we propose to start the generation process from an earlier time step to avoid the unreliable large-time steps of I2V-DMs, as well as an initial noise distribution with optimal analytic expressions (Analytic-Init) by minimizing the KL divergence between it and the actual marginal distribution to bridge the training-inference gap. Second, we design a time-dependent noise distribution (TimeNoise) for the conditional image during training, applying higher noise levels at larger time steps to disrupt it and reduce the model's dependency on it. We validate these general strategies on various I2V-DMs on our collected open-domain image benchmark and the UCF101 dataset. Extensive results show that our methods outperform baselines by producing higher motion scores with lower errors while maintaining image alignment and temporal consistency, thereby yielding superior overall performance and enabling more accurate motion control.

In practice, certain *privileged information* , e.g., the access to states from simulators, has been exploited in training and achieved prominent empirical successes. To better understand the benefits of privileged information, we revisit and examine several simple and practically used paradigms in this setting, with both computation and sample efficiency analyses. Specifically, we first formalize the empirical paradigm of *expert distillation* (also known as  *teacher-student* learning), demonstrating its pitfall in finding near-optimal policies. We then identify a condition of the partially observable environment, the deterministic filter condition, under which expert distillation achieves sample and computational complexities that are *both* polynomial. Furthermore, we investigate another successful empirical paradigm of *asymmetric actor-critic*, and focus on the more challenging setting of observable partially observable Markov decision processes. We develop a belief-weighted optimistic asymmetric actor-critic algorithm with polynomial sample and quasi-polynomial computational complexities, where one key component is a new provable oracle for learning belief states that preserve *filter stability* under a misspecified model, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we also investigate the provable efficiency of partially observable multi-agent RL (MARL) with privileged information. We develop algorithms with the feature of centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution, a popular framework in empirical MARL, with polynomial sample and (quasi-)polynomial computational complexity in both paradigms above.

However, current results indicate that offline RL often performs worse than imitation learning, and it is often unclear what holds back the performance of offline RL. Motivated by this observation, we aim to understand the bottlenecks in current offline RL algorithms. While poor performance of offline RL is typically attributed to an imperfect value function, we ask: *is the main bottleneck of offline RL indeed in learning the value function, or something else?* To answer this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of (1) value learning, (2) policy extraction, and (3) policy generalization in offline RL problems, analyzing how these components affect performance. We make two surprising observations. First, we find that the choice of a policy extraction algorithm significantly affects the performance and scalability of offline RL, often more so than the value learning objective. For instance, we show that common value-weighted behavioral cloning objectives (e.g., AWR) do not fully leverage the learned value function, and switching to behavior-constrained policy gradient objectives (e.g., DDPG+BC) often leads to substantial improvements in performance and scalability. Second, we find that a big barrier to improving offline RL performance is often imperfect policy generalization on test-time states out of the support of the training data, rather than policy learning on in-distribution states. We then show that the use of suboptimal but high-coverage data or test-time policy training techniques can address this generalization issue in practice.

Such intrinsic dynamics would ideally self-organize and self-sustain in the face of biological noise including synaptic turnover and cell death. An example of such dynamics is the formation of sequences, a ubiquitous motif in neural activity. The sequence-generating circuit in zebra finch HVC provides a reliable timing scaffold for motor output in song and demonstrates a remarkable capacity for unsupervised recovery following perturbation. Inspired by HVC, we seek a local plasticity rule capable of organizing and maintaining sequence-generating dynamics despite continual network perturbations. We adopt a meta-learning approach introduced by Confavreux et al, which parameterizes a learning rule using basis functions constructed from pre- and postsynaptic activity and synapse size, with tunable time constants. Candidate rules are simulated within initially random networks, and their fitness is evaluated according to a loss function that measures the fidelity with which the resulting dynamics encode time. We use this approach to introduce biological noise, forcing meta-learning to find robust solutions. We first show that, in the absence of perturbations, meta-learning identifies a temporally asymmetric generalization of Oja's rule that reliably organizes sparse sequential activity. When synaptic turnover is introduced, the learned rule incorporates a form of homeostasis, better maintaining robust sequential dynamics relative to other previously proposed rules. Additionally, inspired by recent findings demonstrating that the strength of projections from inhibitory interneurons in HVC also dynamically responds to perturbations, we explore the role of inhibitory plasticity in sequence-generating circuits. We find that learned plasticity adjusts both excitation and inhibition in response to manipulations, outperforming rules applied only to excitatory connections. We demonstrate how plasticity acting on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can better shape excitatory cell dynamics to scaffold timing representations.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'neuroscience_and_cognitive_science'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/948f2590fccaf36d81c8746ab6c337ba8f5f046b.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/c06a53389ea2f9b67f00e0c1eae62141d2874058.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nbell2024discovering,\\ntitle={Discovering plasticity rules that organize and maintain neural circuits},\\nauthor={David G Bell and Alison Duffy and Adrienne Fairhall},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=nw4TWuEPGx}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'bell|discovering_plasticity_rules_that_organize_and_maintain_neural_circuits'}},forum = 'nw4TWuEPGx',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21525/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21525/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21525/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission21525/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

It excels not only in conventional visual question answering (VQA) but also in open-ended, cross-domain vision tasks such as object localization, pose estimation, and image generation and editing. To this end, we propose a new information transmission mechanism termed ``super link'', as a medium to connect MLLM with task-specific decoders. It not only allows flexible transmission of task information and gradient feedback between the MLLM and multiple downstream decoders but also effectively resolves training conflicts in multi-tasking scenarios. In addition, to support the diverse range of tasks, we carefully collected and combed training data from hundreds of public vision and vision-language tasks. In this way, our model can be joint-trained end-to-end on hundreds of vision language tasks and generalize to these tasks using a set of shared parameters through different user prompts, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models.

On the other hand, structured variants often limit expressivity or fail to deliver the promised latency benefits. We present Sketch Structured Transform (SS1), an expressive and GPU-friendly operator that accelerates inference. SS1 leverages parameter sharing in a random yet structured manner to reduce computation while retraining the rich expressive nature of parameter sharing.

Current models often yield static or minimally dynamic outputs, failing to capture complex motions described by text. This issue stems from the internal biases in text encoding which overlooks motions, and inadequate conditioning mechanisms in T2V generation models. To address this, we propose a novel framework called DEcomposed MOtion (DEMO), which enhances motion synthesis in T2V generation by decomposing both text encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. Our method includes a content encoder for static elements and a motion encoder for temporal dynamics, alongside separate content and motion conditioning mechanisms. Crucially, we introduce text-motion and video-motion supervision to improve the model's understanding and generation of motion.

Notably, federated foundation models (FedFM) emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to FedFM for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications, and conventional methods for test-time distribution shifts in personalized FL are less effective for FedFM due to their failure to adapt to complex distribution shift scenarios and the requirement to train all parameters. To bridge this gap, we refine the setting in FedFM, termed test-time personalization, which aims to learn personalized federated foundation models on clients while effectively handling test-time distribution shifts simultaneously. To address challenges in this setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution, a Federated Dual-Personalizing Adapter (FedDPA) architecture. By co-working with a foundation model, a global adapter and a local adapter jointly tackle the test-time distribution shifts and client-specific personalization. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism that dynamically integrates the global and local adapters for each test instance during inference, facilitating effective test-time personalization.

Recently, the advent of deep learning methods has introduced significant potential for enhancing SAT solving. However, a major barrier to the advancement of this field has been the scarcity of large, realistic datasets.  The majority of current public datasets are either randomly generated or extremely limited, containing only a few examples from unrelated problem families. These datasets are inadequate for meaningful training of deep learning methods.  In light of this, researchers have started exploring generative techniques to create data that more accurately reflect SAT problems encountered in practical situations. These methods have so far suffered from either the inability to produce challenging SAT problems or time-scalability obstacles.  In this paper we address both by identifying and manipulating the key contributors to a problem's ``hardness'', known as cores. Although some previous work has addressed cores, the time costs are unacceptably high due to the expense of traditional heuristic core detection techniques. We introduce a fast core detection procedure that uses a graph neural network. Our empirical results demonstrate that we can efficiently generate problems that remain hard to solve and retain key attributes of the original example problems.

Specifically, based on the block diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix, we first propose the layer-wise sample method to compute each block matrix without performing a complete back-propagation. Then, each block matrix is approximated as a Kronecker product of two smaller matrices, one of which is a diagonal matrix, while keeping the traces equal before and after approximation. By these two steps, we provide a new approximation for the Fisher information matrix, which can effectively reduce the computational cost while preserving the main information of each block matrix. Moreover, we propose a new adaptive layer-wise learning rate to further accelerate training. Based on these new approaches, we propose the LNGD optimizer.

LID can be understood as the number of local factors of variation: the more factors of variation a datum has, the more complex it tends to be. Estimating this quantity has proven useful in contexts ranging from generalization in neural networks to detection of out-of-distribution data, adversarial examples, and AI-generated text. The recent successes of deep generative models present an opportunity to leverage them for LID estimation, but current methods based on generative models produce inaccurate estimates, require more than a single pre-trained model, are computationally intensive, or do not exploit the best available deep generative models: diffusion models (DMs). In this work, we show that the Fokker-Planck equation associated with a DM can provide an LID estimator which addresses the aforementioned deficiencies. Our estimator, called FLIPD, is easy to implement and compatible with all popular DMs. Applying FLIPD to synthetic LID estimation benchmarks, we find that DMs implemented as fully-connected networks are highly effective LID estimators that outperform existing baselines. We also apply FLIPD to natural images where the true LID is unknown. Despite being sensitive to the choice of network architecture, FLIPD estimates remain a useful measure of relative complexity; compared to competing estimators, FLIPD exhibits a consistently higher correlation with image PNG compression rate and better aligns with qualitative assessments of complexity. Notably, FLIPD is orders of magnitude faster than other LID estimators, and the first to be tractable at the scale of Stable Diffusion.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'diffusion_based_models'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 spotlight'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/2923abb88a8b518f873227827f652a291f04f8ac.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nkamkari2024a,\\ntitle={A Geometric View of Data Complexity: Efficient Local Intrinsic Dimension Estimation with Diffusion Models},\\nauthor={Hamidreza Kamkari and Brendan Leigh Ross and Rasa Hosseinzadeh and Jesse C.

Traditional State Space Models (SSMs) are classical approaches for univariate time series modeling due to their simplicity and expressive power to represent linear dependencies. They, however, have fundamentally limited expressive power to capture non-linear dependencies, are slow in practice, and fail to model the inter-variate information flow. Despite recent attempts to improve the expressive power of SSMs by using deep structured SSMs, the existing methods are either limited to univariate time series, fail to model complex patterns (e.g., seasonal patterns), fail to dynamically model the dependencies of variate and time dimensions, and/or are input-independent.  We present Chimera, an expressive variation of the 2-dimensional SSMs with careful design of parameters to maintain high expressive power while keeping the training complexity linear. Using two SSM heads with different discretization processes and input-dependent parameters, Chimera is provably able to learn long-term progression, seasonal patterns, and desirable dynamic autoregressive processes. To improve the efficiency of complex 2D recurrence, we present a fast training using a new 2-dimensional parallel selective scan.

Decoder is typically used to transform the representation in latent space to that in pixel space. While a decoder is assumed to have an encoder as an accurate inverse, exact encoder-decoder pair rarely exists in practice even though applications often require precise inversion of decoder. In other words, encoder is not the left-inverse but the right-inverse of the decoder; decoder inversion seeks the left-inverse. Prior works for decoder inversion in LDMs employed gradient descent inspired by inversions of generative adversarial networks. However, gradient-based methods require larger GPU memory and longer computation time for larger latent space. For example, recent video LDMs can generate more than 16 frames, but GPUs with 24 GB memory can only perform gradient-based decoder inversion for 4 frames. Here, we propose an efficient gradient-free decoder inversion for LDMs, which can be applied to diverse latent models.

However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, non-oversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs.

Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\\\\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval.

Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches are resource-intensive and may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR significantly enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across twelve benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62\\\\%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm.

Understanding why their performance differs is crucial for determining what types of interventions (e.g., algorithmic or operational) are most effective at closing the performance gaps. Aggregate decompositions express the total performance gap as the gap due to a shift in the feature distribution $p(X)$ plus the gap due to a shift in the outcome's conditional  distribution $p(Y|X)$. While this coarse explanation is helpful for guiding root cause analyses, it provides limited details and can only suggest coarse fixes involving all variables in an ML system. Detailed decompositions quantify the importance of each variable to each term in the aggregate decomposition, which can provide a deeper understanding and suggest more targeted interventions. Although parametric methods exist for conducting a full hierarchical decomposition of an algorithm's performance gap at the aggregate and detailed levels, current nonparametric methods only cover parts of the hierarchy; many also require knowledge of the entire causal graph.

We describe an approximation that allows us to constrain the number of time steps an RNN takes to solve a task with human RTs. The approach is extensively evaluated against various psychophysics experiments. We also show that the approximation can be used to optimize an ``ideal-observer'' RNN model to achieve an optimal tradeoff between speed and accuracy without human data. The resulting model is found to account well for human RT data. Finally, we use the approximation to train a deep learning implementation of the popular Wong-Wang decision-making model. The model is integrated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model of visual processing and evaluated using both artificial and natural image stimuli.

Albeit high meaningful for many applications, metrics capable of measuring these cases of misclassifications in visual emotion recognition tasks have yet to be explored.

Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns.

We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data.

The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation.

Shared autonomy (SA) facilitates control by combining inputs from a human pilot and an AI copilot. In prior SA studies, the copilot is constantly active in determining the action played at each time step. This limits human autonomy that may have deleterious effects on performance. In general, the amount of helpful copilot assistance varies greatly depending on the task dynamics. We therefore hypothesized that human autonomy and SA performance improves through dynamic and selective copilot intervention. To address this, we develop a goal-agnostic intervention assistance (IA) that dynamically shares control by having the copilot intervene only when the expected value of the copilot’s action exceeds that of the human’s action. We implement IA with a diffusion copilot (termed IDA) trained on expert demonstrations with goal masking. We prove that IDA performance is lower bounded by human performance, so that IDA does not negatively impact human control. In experiments with simulated human pilots, we show that IDA achieves higher performance than both pilot-only and traditional SA control in variants of the Reacher environment and Lunar Lander. We then demonstrate with human-in the-loop experiments that IDA achieves better control in Lunar Lander and that human participants experience greater autonomy and prefer IDA over pilot-only and traditional SA control.

Accurately estimating an instance\\'s noise transition matrix is crucial for estimating its clean label. However, when only a noisy dataset is available, noise transition matrices can be estimated only for some \"special\" instances. To leverage these estimated transition matrices to help estimate the transition matrices of other instances, it is essential to explore relations between the matrices of these \"special\" instances and those of others. Existing studies typically build the relation by explicitly defining the similarity between the estimated noise transition matrices of \"special\" instances and those of other instances. However, these similarity-based assumptions are hard to validate and may not align with real-world data. If these assumptions fail, both noise transition matrices and clean labels cannot be accurately estimated. In this paper, we found that by learning the latent causal structure governing the generating process of noisy data, we can estimate noise transition matrices without the need for similarity-based assumptions. Unlike previous generative label-noise learning methods, we consider causal relations between latent causal variables and model them with a learnable graphical model. Utilizing only noisy data, our method can effectively learn the latent causal structure. Experimental results on various noisy datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in estimating noise transition matrices, which leads to improved classification accuracy.

In the diffusion process, the ground truth scene flow vector field is gradually perturbed by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, starting from randomly sampled Gaussian noise, the scene flow vector field prediction is recovered by conditioning on a source and a target point cloud. We show that the diffusion process greatly increases the robustness of predictions compared to prior approaches resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard scene flow estimation benchmarks. Moreover, by sampling multiple times with different initial states, the denoising process predicts multiple hypotheses, which enables measuring the output uncertainty, allowing our approach to detect a majority of the inaccurate predictions.

Analyzing the fundamental reasons for these limitations, we model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem with local inconsistency and edge deformation noises. We propose the Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework to enforce robustness against the noises, which mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance. With noisy depth predictions as input, SDDR generates low-noise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels by coarse-to-fine self-distillation. Edge-based guidance with edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss serves as the optimization objective equivalent to Poisson fusion. When depth maps are better refined, the labels also become more noise-free. Our model can acquire strong robustness to the noises, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, edge quality, efficiency, and generalizability on five different benchmarks.

In this paper, we delve into the reason for the unsatisfactory performance and conjecture that it comes from interference in the training process. Due to occlusions in complex scenes, a 3D point may be invisible to some rays. On such a point, training with those rays that do not contain valid information about the point might interfere with the NeRF training. Based on the above intuition, we decouple the training process of NeRF in the ray dimension softly and propose a Ray-decoupled Training Framework for neural rendering (Rad-NeRF). Specifically, we construct an ensemble of sub-NeRFs and train a soft gate module to assign the gating scores to these sub-NeRFs based on specific rays. The gate module is jointly optimized with the sub-NeRF ensemble to learn the preference of sub-NeRFs for different rays automatically. Furthermore, we introduce depth-based mutual learning to enhance the rendering consistency among multiple sub-NeRFs and mitigate the depth ambiguity. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that Rad-NeRF can enhance the rendering performance across a wide range of scene types compared with existing single-NeRF and multi-NeRF methods. With only 0.2% extra parameters, Rad-NeRF improves rendering performance by up to 1.5dB.

To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework that fine-tunes VLMs with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our framework provides a task description and then prompts the VLM to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the VLM to efficiently explore intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the final text-based action. Next, the open-ended text output is parsed into an executable action to interact with the environment to obtain goal-directed task rewards. Finally, our framework uses these task rewards to fine-tune the entire VLM with RL. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed framework enhances the decision-making capabilities of VLM agents across various tasks, enabling 7b models to outperform commercial models such as GPT4-V or Gemini.

We introduce UniTS, a unified multi-task time series model that utilizes task tokenization to integrate predictive and generative tasks into a single framework. UniTS employs a modified transformer block to capture universal time series representations, enabling transferability from a heterogeneous, multi-domain pre-training dataset—characterized by diverse dynamic patterns, sampling rates, and temporal scales—to a wide range of downstream datasets with varied task specifications and data domains.

In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1\\\\% training data.

Due to class imbalance, transferred models exhibit strong bias, where features of the major class dominate over those of the minor class. In this paper, we propose debLoRA, a generic training approach that works with any LoRA variants to yield debiased features. It is an unsupervised learning approach that can diversify minor class features based on the shared attributes with major classes, where the attributes are obtained by a simple step of clustering. To evaluate it, we conduct extensive experiments in two transfer learning scenarios in the RS domain: from natural to optical RS images, and from optical RS to multi-spectrum RS images. We perform object classification and oriented object detection tasks on the optical RS dataset DOTA and the SAR dataset FUSRS.

In this paper, we first investigate the discretization gap and propose a novel structural differentiable mask pruning framework named S2HPruner to bridge the discretization gap in a one-stage manner. In the training procedure, SH2Pruner forwards both the soft network and its corresponding hard network, then distills the hard network under the supervision of the soft network. To optimize the mask and prevent performance degradation, we propose a decoupled bidirectional knowledge distillation. It blocks the weight updating from the hard to the soft network while maintaining the gradient corresponding to the mask. Compared with existing pruning arts, S2HPruner achieves surpassing pruning performance without fine-tuning on comprehensive benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet with a variety of network architectures.

One effective strategy is to use a model ensemble, which leverages the diverse expertise of different models to transfer knowledge to evolving data distributions. However, this approach faces difficulties when the dynamic test distribution is available only in small batches and without access to the original source data. To address the challenge of adapting to dynamic distributions in such practical settings, we propose continual multi-source adaptation to dynamic distributions (CONTRAST), a novel method that optimally combines multiple source models to adapt to the dynamic test data. CONTRAST has two distinguishing features. First, it efficiently computes the optimal combination weights to combine the source models to adapt to the test data distribution continuously as a function of time. Second, it identifies which of the source model parameters to update so that only the model which is most correlated to the target data is adapted, leaving the less correlated ones untouched; this mitigates the issue of ``forgetting\" the source model parameters by focusing only on the source model that exhibits the strongest correlation with the test batch distribution. Through theoretical analysis we show that the proposed method is able to optimally combine the source models and prioritize updates to the model least prone to forgetting. Experimental analysis on diverse datasets demonstrates that the combination of multiple source models does at least as well as the best source (with hindsight knowledge), and performance does not degrade as the test data distribution changes over time (robust to forgetting).'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'online_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/e782de99a42bd7cbb46ed030b5bdbf45b070ae1f.pdf'}, 'TLDR': {'value': 'We propose the first work to consider dynamically evolving multi-source adaptation at test time.'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nahmed2024contrast,\\ntitle={{CONTRAST}: Continual Multi-source Adaptation to Dynamic Distributions},\\nauthor={Sk Miraj Ahmed and Fahim Faisal Niloy and Xiangyu Chang and Dripta S.

Traditional approaches predominantly address Normal Outliers, which are activations across all tokens with relatively large magnitudes.

In this paper, we introduce DuQuant, a novel approach that utilizes rotation and permutation transformations to more effectively mitigate both massive and normal outliers. First, DuQuant starts by constructing the rotation matrix, using specific outlier dimensions as prior knowledge, to redistribute outliers to adjacent channels by block-wise rotation. Second, We further employ a zigzag permutation to balance the distribution of outliers across blocks, thereby reducing block-wise variance. A subsequent rotation further smooths the activation landscape, enhancing model performance. DuQuant simplifies the quantization process and excels in managing outliers, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines across various sizes and types of LLMs on multiple tasks, even with 4-bit weight-activation quantization.

Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication towards effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry.

In particular, we propose a learnable symmetric Conv filter, with weights shared over the entire model, to accurately estimate the spatial derivatives of PDE based on the neural-corrected system state. The resulting physics-encoded model is capable of handling limited training data (e.g., 3--5 trajectories) and accelerates the prediction of PDE solutions on coarse spatiotemporal grids while maintaining a high accuracy.

Building upon these findings, we propose Difference Matrix-based Neural Network (DMNet), a subject-independent seizure detection model, which leverages self-comparison based on two constructed (contextual, channel-level) references to mitigate shifts of iEEG, and utilize a simple yet effective difference matrix to encode the universal seizure patterns. Extensive experiments show that DMNet significantly outperforms previous SOTAs while maintaining high efficiency on a real-world clinical dataset collected by us and two public datasets for subject-independent seizure detection. Moreover, the visualization results demonstrate that the generated difference matrix can effectively capture the seizure activity changes during the seizure evolution process. Additionally, we deploy our method in an online diagnosis system to illustrate its effectiveness in real clinical applications.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_learning_for_healthcare'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/72bd52ddff251b9f910257ff0b20a7f4bb236452.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/c4ae1d4d6b58f349801ececb9bdcbb47c72d2d80.zip'}, 'flagged_for_ethics_review': {'value': True}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\ntu2024dmnet,\\ntitle={{DMN}et: Self-comparison Driven Model for Subject-independent Seizure Detection},\\nauthor={Shihao Tu and Linfeng Cao and Daoze Zhang and Junru Chen and Lvbin Ma and Yin Zhang and Yang Yang},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=mlmTxJwVsb}\\n}'}, 'TLDR': {'value': 'DMNet is a self-comparison driven model designed for subject-independent seizure detection.'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'tu|dmnet_selfcomparison_driven_model_for_subjectindependent_seizure_detection'}},forum = 'mlmTxJwVsb',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8883/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8883/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8883/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Ethics_Review_Flag', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8883/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

In this paper, we present a novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views.

Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views.

Unlike traditional offline methods that rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating the model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing environments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity of the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve generalization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap for human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel causal diffusion model called DiffPO, which is carefully designed for reliable inferences in medicine by learning the distribution of potential outcomes. In our DiffPO, we leverage a tailored conditional denoising diffusion model to learn complex distributions, where we address the selection bias through a novel orthogonal diffusion loss.

In this work, we identify a goal-agnostic prerequisite to meaningful communication, which we term semantic consistency, based on the idea that messages should have similar meanings across instances. We provide a formal definition for this idea, and use it to compare the two most common objectives in the field of emergent communication: discrimination and reconstruction. We prove, under mild assumptions, that semantically inconsistent communication protocols can be optimal solutions to the discrimination task, but not to reconstruction. We further show that the reconstruction objective encourages a stricter property, spatial meaningfulness, which also accounts for the distance between messages.

Stochastic optimal control theory offers a mathematical framework to explain these processes at the algorithmic level through optimality principles.

Currently, the algorithm that is commonly used is the one proposed in the seminal study in (Todorov, 2005). After discovering some pitfalls in the original derivation, i.e., unbiased estimation does not hold, we improve the algorithm by proposing an efficient gradient descent-based optimization that minimizes the cost-to-go while only imposing linearity of the control law. The optimal solution is obtained by iteratively propagating in closed form the sufficient statistics to compute the expected cost and then minimizing this cost with respect to the filter and control gains. We demonstrate that this approach results in a significantly lower overall cost than current state-of-the-art solutions, particularly in the presence of internal noise, though the improvement is present in other circumstances as well, with theoretical explanations for this enhanced performance.

This paper aims at the third, i.e., developing the Sampling-exploration enhanced A$^*$ (SeeA$^*$) search by constructing a dynamic subset of OPEN through a selective sampling process, such that the node with the best heuristic value in this subset instead of in the OPEN is expanded. Nodes with the best heuristic values in OPEN are most probably picked into this subset, but sometimes may not be included, which enables SeeA$^*$ to explore other promising branches. Three sampling techniques are presented for comparative investigations.

Network operators need an efficient method to identify the root causes of these alarms to mitigate potential losses. This task is challenging due to the increasing scale of telecommunication networks and the interconnected nature of devices, where one fault can trigger a cascade of alarms across multiple devices within a topological network. Recent years have seen a growing focus on causal approaches to addressing this problem, emphasizing the importance of learning a Granger causal graph from topological event sequences. Such causal graphs delineate the relations among alarms and can significantly aid engineers in identifying and rectifying faults. However, existing methods either ignore the topological relationships among devices or suffer from relatively low scalability and efficiency, failing to deliver high-quality responses in a timely manner. To this end, this paper proposes $S^2GCSL$, a simple yet scalable Granger causal structural learning approach for topological event sequences. $S^2GCSL$ utilizes a linear kernel to model activation interactions among various event types within a topological network, and employs gradient descent to efficiently optimize the likelihood function. Notably, it can seamlessly incorporate expert knowledge as constraints within the optimization process, which enhances the interpretability of the outcomes. Extensive experimental results on both large-scale synthetic and real-world problems verify the scalability and efficacy of $S^2GCSL$.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'causal_inference'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/5ffde646c6f78d98a34098818f079bb9ae62df7b.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nli2024a,\\ntitle={A Simple yet Scalable Granger Causal Structural Learning Approach for Topological Event Sequences},\\nauthor={Mingjia Li and Shuo Liu and Hong Qian and Aimin Zhou},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=mP084aMFsd}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'li|a_simple_yet_scalable_granger_causal_structural_learning_approach_for_topological_event_sequences'}},forum = 'mP084aMFsd',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18531/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18531/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18531/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission18531/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY-NC 4.0'),\n",

Specifically, during training, we present to generate scaled-up comparative instructions by comparing images from the same IQA dataset, allowing for more flexible integration of diverse IQA datasets. Utilizing the established large-scale training corpus, we develop a human-like visual quality comparator.

The quality score is further optimized by maximum a posteriori estimation with the resulting probability matrix. Extensive experiments on nine IQA datasets validate that the Compare2Score effectively bridges text-defined comparative levels during training with converted single image quality scores for inference, surpassing state-of-the-art IQA models across diverse scenarios.

To tackle the imbalance inherent in long-tailed data, we design a dynamic rebalancing strategy that adjusts the sampling of underrepresented instances throughout the pre-training process, ensuring better representation of tail classes.

This paper addresses these challenges and aims to identify edges that exist in at least one component DAG of the mixture, referred to as the *true* edges. First, it establishes matching necessary and sufficient conditions on the size of interventions required to identify the true edges. Next, guided by the necessity results, an adaptive algorithm is designed that learns all true edges using ${\\\\cal O}(n^2)$ interventions, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Remarkably, the size of the interventions is optimal if the underlying mixture model does not contain cycles across its components. More generally, the gap between the intervention size used by the algorithm and the optimal size is quantified. It is shown to be bounded by the *cyclic complexity number* of the mixture model, defined as the size of the minimal intervention that can break the cycles in the mixture, which is upper bounded by the number of cycles among the ancestors of a node.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'causal_inference'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/1b479d170e7f3c5cbb35a67cb00b9fc4c4843848.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nvar{\\\\i}c{\\\\i}2024interventional,\\ntitle={Interventional Causal Discovery in a Mixture of {DAG}s},\\nauthor={Burak Var{\\\\i}c{\\\\i} and Dmitriy A Katz and Dennis Wei and Prasanna Sattigeri and Ali Tajer},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=mFrlCI8sov}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'varc|interventional_causal_discovery_in_a_mixture_of_dags'}},forum = 'mFrlCI8sov',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12228/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12228/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12228/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12228/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains.

In our extensive experiments amounting to 1060 GPU days, we show that merely augmenting the computational resources is insufficient to tackle this challenge. Our findings underline a notable performance decline when solely relying on labeled data when the label delay becomes significant. More surprisingly, when using state-of-the-art SSL and TTA techniques to utilize the newer, unlabeled data, they fail to surpass the performance of a naïve method that simply trains on the delayed supervised stream. To this end, we introduce a simple, efficient baseline that rehearses from the labeled memory samples that are most similar to the new unlabeled samples. This method bridges the accuracy gap caused by label delay without significantly increasing computational complexity. We show experimentally that our method is the least affected by the label delay factor and in some cases successfully recovers the accuracy of the non-delayed counterpart. We conduct various ablations and sensitivity experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'online_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/170ed172ba6d096fafba4f36e54f20fec4c17dcf.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\ncsaba2024label,\\ntitle={Label Delay in Online Continual Learning},\\nauthor={Botos Csaba and Wenxuan Zhang and Matthias M{\\\\\"u}ller and Ser-Nam Lim and Philip Torr and Adel Bibi},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=m5CAnUui0Z}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'csaba|label_delay_in_online_continual_learning'}},forum = 'm5CAnUui0Z',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14288/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14288/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14288/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission14288/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

In this paper, we initiate the study of scaling properties of compound inference systems. We analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of LM calls affects the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote, two of the simplest compound system designs, which aggregate LM responses via majority voting, optionally applying LM filters. We find, surprisingly, that across multiple language tasks, the performance of both Vote and Filter-Vote can first increase but then decrease as a function of the number of LM calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to the diversity of query difficulties within a task: more LM calls lead to higher performance on \"easy\" queries, but lower performance on \"hard\" queries, and non-monotone behavior can emerge when a task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number of samples, the number of LM calls that maximizes system performance, and define an analytical scaling model for both systems. Experiments show that our scaling model can accurately predict the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote systems and thus find the optimal number of LM calls to make.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'generative_models'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/933389eba2d451a433d83e7d55975efe12b0a17b.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nchen2024are,\\ntitle={Are More {LLM} Calls All You Need?

To this end, we begin by investigating the permutation invariance property of GNNs, which leads us to develop two vanilla approaches for Grama: Vanilla Parameter Interpolation (VPI) and Vanilla Alignment Prior to Interpolation (VAPI), both employing topology-independent interpolation in the parameter space. However, neither approach has achieved the anticipated results. Through theoretical analysis of VPI and VAPI, we identify critical challenges unique to Grama, including increased sensitivity to parameter misalignment and further the inherent topology-dependent complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose the Dual-Message Coordination and Calibration (DuMCC) methodology, comprising the Parent Message Coordination (PMC) scheme to optimise the permutation matrices for parameter interpolation by coordinating aggregated messages, and the Child Message Calibration (CMC) scheme to mitigate over-smoothing identified in PMC by calibrating the message statistics within child GNNs.

Motivated by these challenges, our study introduces a novel scanning method named TRODO (TROjan scanning by Detection of adversarial shifts in Out-of-distribution samples). TRODO leverages the concept of \"blind spots\"—regions where trojaned classifiers erroneously identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples as in-distribution (ID). We scan for these blind spots by adversarially shifting OOD samples towards in-distribution. The increased likelihood of perturbed OOD samples being classified as ID serves as a signature for trojan detection. TRODO is both trojan and label mapping agnostic, effective even against adversarially trained trojaned classifiers.

We show that such a problem can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained convex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous gradient according to the duality theorem. Then, based on an accelerated gradient descent algorithm with numerical performance enhancement, we present our architecture, GLinSAT, to solve the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general linear satisfiability layer in which all the operations are differentiable and matrix-factorization-free.

To instantiate this framework, we design a text-based planning task, where an LLM acts as an agent in an environment and interacts with objects in containers to achieve a specified goal state.

Inspired by biologically plausible neuroscience theories of cognition, we propose Predictive Attractor Models (PAM), a novel sequence memory architecture with desirable generative properties. PAM is a streaming model that learns a sequence in an online, continuous manner by observing each input only once. Additionally, we find that PAM avoids catastrophic forgetting by uniquely representing past context through lateral inhibition in cortical minicolumns, which prevents new memories from overwriting previously learned knowledge. PAM generates future predictions by sampling from a union set of predicted possibilities; this generative ability is realized through an attractor model trained alongside the predictor. We show that PAM is trained with local computations through Hebbian plasticity rules in a biologically plausible framework. Other desirable traits (e.g., noise tolerance, CPU-based learning, capacity scaling) are discussed throughout the paper. Our findings suggest that PAM represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of biologically plausible and computationally efficient sequential memory models, with broad implications for cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.

Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads.

Upon on these findings, in this paper, we propose an Empirical MDP Iteration (EMIT) framework. EMIT constructs a sequence of empirical MDPs using data from the growing replay memory. For each of these empirical MDPs, it learns an estimated Q-function denoted as $\\\\widehat{Q}$. The key strength is that by restricting the Bellman update to in-sample bootstrapping, each empirical MDP converges to a unique optimal $\\\\widehat{Q}$ function. Furthermore, gradually expanding from the empirical MDPs to the original MDP induces a monotonic policy improvement. Instead of creating entirely new algorithms, we demonstrate that EMIT can be seamlessly integrated with existing online RL algorithms, effectively acting as a regularizer for contemporary Q-learning methods. We show this by implementing EMIT for two representative RL algorithms, DQN and TD3.

However, practical applications do not always require the classification of all kinds of objects, and leaving the model capable of recognizing unnecessary classes not only degrades overall accuracy but also leads to operational disadvantages. To mitigate this issue, we explore the selective forgetting problem for PTMs, where the task is to make the model unable to recognize only the specified classes, while maintaining accuracy for the rest. All the existing methods assume ''white-box'' settings, where model information such as architectures, parameters, and gradients is available for training. However, PTMs are often ''black-box,'' where information on such models is unavailable for commercial reasons or social responsibilities. In this paper, we address a novel problem of selective forgetting for black-box models, named Black-Box Forgetting, and propose an approach to the problem. Given that information on the model is unavailable, we optimize the input prompt to decrease the accuracy of specified classes through derivative-free optimization. To avoid difficult high-dimensional optimization while ensuring high forgetting performance, we propose Latent Context Sharing, which introduces common low-dimensional latent components among multiple tokens for the prompt.

To address this, we present a 3D Gaussian-based novel view synthesis method using sparse input images that can accurately render the scene from the viewpoints not covered by the training images. We propose a multi-stage training scheme with matching-based consistency constraints imposed on the novel views without relying on pre-trained depth estimation or diffusion models. This is achieved by using the matches of the available training images to supervise the generation of the novel views sampled between the training frames with color, geometry, and semantic losses. In addition, we introduce a locality preserving regularization for 3D Gaussians which removes rendering artifacts by preserving the local color structure of the scene.

For both third-person and first-person (egocentric) videos, state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods aim at finding correspondences across videos in time to accomplish procedure learning. However, to establish temporal relationships within the sequences, these methods often rely on frame-to-frame mapping, or assume monotonic alignment of video pairs, leading to sub-optimal results. To this end, we propose to treat the video frames as  samples from an unknown distribution, enabling us to frame their distance calculation as an optimal transport (OT) problem. Notably, the OT-based formulation allows us to relax the previously mentioned assumptions. To further improve performance, we enhance the OT formulation by introducing two regularization terms. The first,  inverse difference moment regularization, promotes transportation between instances that are homogeneous in the embedding space as well as being temporally closer. The second, regularization based on the KL-divergence with an exponentially decaying prior smooths the alignment while enforcing conformity to the optimality (alignment obtained from vanilla OT optimization) and temporal priors. The resultant optimal transport guided procedure learning framework (`OPEL') significantly outperforms the SOTA on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we achieve 22.4\\\\% (IoU) and 26.9\\\\% (F1) average improvement compared to the current SOTA on large scale egocentric benchmark, EgoProceL.

To solve the problem, a promising solution motivated by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial LVLMs such as GPT-4V.

In this paper, we collect pedestrian-vehicle collision pose from the dashcam perspective of dashcam and construct the first Pedestrian-Vehicle Collision Pose dataset (PVCP) in a semi-automatic way, including 40k+ accident frames and 20K+ pedestrian pre-collision pose annotation (2D, 3D, Mesh).

The PPSENet first estimates the 2D pose from the image (Image to Pose, ITP) and then lifts the 2D pose to 3D mesh (Pose to Mesh, PTM). Due to the small size of the dataset, we introduce a pre-training model that learns the human pose prior on a large number of pose datasets, and use iterative regression to estimate the pre-collision pose and shape of pedestrians.

Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method out-performs existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Ampère PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

In recent years, machine learning models have proliferated for analyzing EHR data to predict patients' future health conditions. Among them, some studies advocate for multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly predict multiple target diseases for improving the prediction performance over single task learning. Nevertheless, current MTL frameworks for EHR data have significant limitations due to their heavy reliance on human experts to identify task groups for joint training and design model architectures. To reduce human intervention and improve the framework design, we propose an automated approach named AutoDP, which can search for the optimal configuration of task grouping and architectures simultaneously.

However, the drafting process in speculative decoding includes slow autoregressive generation and allocates equal time to generating tokens, irrespective of their importance. These inefficiencies collectively contribute to the suboptimal performance of speculative decoding. To further improve LLM inference, we introduce Cascade Speculative Drafting (CS Drafting), a speculative execution algorithm that incorporates two types of cascades. The *Vertical Cascade* eliminates autoregressive generation from neural models, while the *Horizontal Cascade* optimizes time allocation in drafting for improved efficiency.

To tackle this issue, we propose Elect, Mask & Rescale-Merging (EMR-Merging).

In this work, we develop a stronger characterization of the optimization and generalization landscape of ICL through contributions on architectures, low-rank parameterization, and correlated designs: (1) We study the landscape of 1-layer linear attention and 1-layer H3, a state-space model. Under a suitable correlated design assumption, we prove that both implement 1-step preconditioned gradient descent. We show that thanks to its native convolution filters, H3 also has the advantage of implementing sample weighting and outperforming linear attention in suitable settings. (2) By studying correlated designs, we provide new risk bounds for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and task-feature alignment which reveal how ICL sample complexity benefits from distributional alignment. (3) We derive the optimal risk for low-rank parameterized attention weights in terms of covariance spectrum. Through this, we also shed light on how LoRA can adapt to a new distribution by capturing the shift between task covariances. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.

To boost the token acceptance rate while minimizing the latency of the self-drafting model, we introduce an additional \\\\emph{early exiting} mechanism for both single-sequence and the tree decoding scenarios. Specifically, we dynamically halt the small model's subsequent prediction during the drafting phase once the confidence level for the current step falls below a certain threshold.

Unlike humans, these '*Large Language Models*' (LLMs) are highly sensitive to small changes in their inputs, leading to unwanted inconsistency in their behavior. One problematic inconsistency when LLMs are used to answer multiple-choice questions or analyze multiple inputs is *order dependency*: the output of an LLM can (and often does) change significantly when sub-sequences are swapped, despite both orderings being semantically identical. In this paper we present , a technique that *guarantees* the output of an LLM will not have order dependence on a specified set of sub-sequences. We show that this method *provably* eliminates order dependency, and that it can be applied to *any* transformer-based LLM to enable text generation that is unaffected by re-orderings. Delving into the implications of our method, we show that, despite our inputs being out of distribution, the impact on expected accuracy is small, where the expectation is over the order of uniformly chosen shuffling of the candidate responses, and usually significantly less in practice. Thus, can be used as a '*dropped-in*' method on fully trained models. Finally, we discuss how our method's success suggests that other strong guarantees can be obtained on LLM performance via modifying the input representations.\\n\\nCode is available at [github.com/reidmcy/set-based-prompting](https://github.com/reidmcy/set-based-prompting.).\"}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/70ccc1cf119b3e0022271b0391a23ec802dae939.pdf'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'generative_models'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/25d494ed09b901ee73225f77c01cd36ed85a5fea.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nmcilroy-young2024orderindependence,\\ntitle={Order-Independence Without Fine Tuning},\\nauthor={Reid McIlroy-Young and Katrina Brown and Conlan Olson and Linjun Zhang and Cynthia Dwork},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lQ45aR8L7D}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'mcilroyyoung|orderindependence_without_fine_tuning'}},forum = 'lQ45aR8L7D',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1858/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1858/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1858/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission1858/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

While they are capable of generating human-like responses, they can also produce undesirable output including potentially harmful information, racist or sexist language, and hallucinations. Alignment methods are designed to reduce such undesirable output, via techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and representation engineering. However, existing methods face several challenges: some require costly fine-tuning for every alignment task; some do not adequately remove undesirable concepts, failing alignment; some remove benign concepts, lowering the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Parsimonious Concept Engineering (PaCE), a novel activation engineering framework for alignment. First, to sufficiently model the concepts, we construct a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, in which each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given any alignment task, we instruct a concept partitioner to efficiently annotate the concepts as benign or undesirable. Then, at inference time, we decompose the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding, to accurately represent the activations as linear combinations of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activations, we reorient the behavior of the LLM towards the alignment goal. We conduct experiments on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, and show that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance while maintaining linguistic capabilities.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'generative_models'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/0d56400d745f8d9a97b66ace937cb8f59ab08390.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/540e3153649547b718e80b9890a73f21d73d0393.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nluo2024pace,\\ntitle={Pa{CE}: Parsimonious Concept Engineering for Large Language Models},\\nauthor={Jinqi Luo and Tianjiao Ding and Kwan Ho Ryan Chan and Darshan Thaker and Aditya Chattopadhyay and Chris Callison-Burch and Rene Vidal},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lOMHt16T8R}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'luo|pace_parsimonious_concept_engineering_for_large_language_models'}},forum = 'lOMHt16T8R',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8804/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8804/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8804/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission8804/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Besides,  lower-order exercise latent representations obtained in shallow layers are not well explored when learning the student representation. \\nTo tackle the issues, this paper suggests a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD (DisenGCD), which learns three types of representations on three disentangled graphs: student-exercise-concept interaction,  exercise-concept relation, and concept dependency graphs, respectively. \\nSpecifically,  the latter two graphs are first disentangled from the interaction graph. \\nThen, the student representation is learned from the interaction graph by a devised meta multigraph learning module; multiple learnable propagation paths in this module  enable current student latent representation to access  lower-order exercise latent representations,\\nwhich can lead to  more effective nad robust student representations learned; \\nthe exercise and concept representations are learned on the relation and dependency graphs by graph attention modules. \\nFinally, a novel diagnostic function is devised to handle three disentangled representations for prediction.  Experiments show better performance and robustness of DisenGCD than state-of-the-art CD methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled learning framework and meta multigraph module.The source code is available at https://github.com/BIMK/Intelligent-Education/tree/main/DisenGCD.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_learning_for_other_sciences_and_fields'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/e51af5d4e5dbe15572e497a2ca8aadbb75729501.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/6b4182aca74183a6ff68f78313ea081482a5546c.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nyang2024disengcd,\\ntitle={Disen{GCD}: A Meta Multigraph-assisted Disentangled Graph Learning Framework for  Cognitive Diagnosis},\\nauthor={Shangshang Yang and Mingyang Chen and Ziwen Wang and Xiaoshan Yu and Panpan Zhang and Haiping Ma and Xingyi Zhang},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lJuQxkDbDo}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'yang|disengcd_a_meta_multigraphassisted_disentangled_graph_learning_framework_for_cognitive_diagnosis'}},forum = 'lJuQxkDbDo',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3048/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3048/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3048/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3048/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Recent studies have shown that pure self-attention suffers from an increasing degree of rank collapse as depth increases, limiting model expressivity and further utilization of model depth.

In this paper, we provide a general analysis of rank collapse under self-attention, taking into account the effects of attention masks and layer normalization (LayerNorm). In particular, we find that although pure masked attention still suffers from exponential collapse to a rank one subspace, sparse or local masked attention can provably slow down the collapse rate. In the case of self-attention with LayerNorm, we first show that for certain classes of value matrices, collapse to a rank one subspace still happens exponentially. However, through construction of nontrivial counterexamples, we then establish that with proper choice of value matrices, a general class of sequences may not converge to a rank one subspace, and the self-attention dynamics with LayerNorm can simultaneously possess a rich set of equilibria with any possible rank between one and full. Our result refutes the previous hypothesis that LayerNorm plays no role in the rank collapse of self-attention and suggests that self-attention with LayerNorm constitutes a much more expressive, versatile nonlinear dynamical system than what was originally thought.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'learning_theory'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/e3f16b5718fda36c132a629e2933050ff3bab9e7.pdf'}, 'TLDR': {'value': 'We rigorously show that sparse or local masked attention can mitigate rank collapse of tokens, while LayerNorm can prevent it in transformers, both enhancing model expressivity.'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nwu2024on,\\ntitle={On the Role of Attention Masks and LayerNorm in Transformers},\\nauthor={Xinyi Wu and Amir Ajorlou and Yifei Wang and Stefanie Jegelka and Ali Jadbabaie},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=lIH6oCdppg}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'wu|on_the_role_of_attention_masks_and_layernorm_in_transformers'}},forum = 'lIH6oCdppg',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12136/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12136/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12136/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission12136/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Moreover, as often occurs in practice, when expert datasets are collected from an arbitrary state distribution instead of a stationary one, these shifts become more pronounced, potentially leading to substantial failures in existing IL methods. Specifically, we focus on covariate shift resulting from arbitrary state data distributions, such as biased data collection or incomplete trajectories, rather than shifts induced by changes in dynamics or noisy expert actions.

However, existing research primarily focuses on reducing the theoretical computational complexity through methods such as local attention and model pruning, rather than considering realistic performance on mobile hardware. Although these optimizations reduce computational demands, they either introduce additional overheads related to data transformation (e.g., Reshape and Transpose) or irregular computation/data-access patterns. These result in significant overhead on mobile devices due to their limited bandwidth, which even makes the latency worse than vanilla ViT on mobile.

We identify the main bottleneck in transformer structures caused by data transformation and propose a hardware-friendly core-periphery guided self-attention to decrease computation demands.

Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules.

While state space models (SSMs) have shown promise in the long-sequence modeling, they face challenges in combining local invariants and global context in visual data. In this paper, we introduce MambaLLIE, an implicit Retinex-aware low light enhancer featuring a global-then-local state space design. We first propose a Local-Enhanced State Space Module (LESSM) that incorporates an augmented local bias within a 2D selective scan mechanism, enhancing the original SSMs by preserving local 2D dependency. Additionally, an Implicit Retinex-aware Selective Kernel module (IRSK) dynamically selects features using spatially-varying operations, adapting to varying inputs through an adaptive kernel selection process. Our Global-then-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) integrates LESSM and IRSK with layer normalization (LN) as its core. This design enables MambaLLIE to achieve comprehensive global long-range modeling and flexible local feature aggregation.

However, the reward corresponding to an optimal policy is not unique, making it unclear if an IRL-learned reward is transferable to new transition laws in the sense that its optimal policy aligns with the optimal policy corresponding to the expert's true reward. Past work has addressed this problem only under the assumption of full access to the expert's policy, guaranteeing transferability when learning from two experts with the same reward but different transition laws that satisfy a specific rank condition [Rolland et al., 2022]. In this work, we show that the conditions developed under full access to the expert's policy cannot guarantee transferability in the more practical scenario where we have access only to demonstrations of the expert. Instead of a binary rank condition, we propose principal angles as a more refined measure of similarity and dissimilarity between transition laws. Based on this, we then establish two key results: 1) a sufficient condition for transferability to any transition laws when learning from at least two experts with sufficiently different transition laws, and 2) a sufficient condition for transferability to local changes in the transition law when learning from a single expert. Furthermore, we also provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm and an end-to-end analysis for learning transferable rewards from demonstrations of multiple experts.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'reinforcement_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/91b311c232293f7b6542e2c230bbdabd28d5b427.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/3d0f3744530a5a023386fa8947d2547a0d17133c.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nschlaginhaufen2024towards,\\ntitle={Towards the Transferability of Rewards Recovered via Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning},\\nauthor={Andreas Schlaginhaufen and Maryam Kamgarpour},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=l5wEQPcDab}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'schlaginhaufen|towards_the_transferability_of_rewards_recovered_via_regularized_inverse_reinforcement_learning'}},forum = 'l5wEQPcDab',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7256/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7256/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7256/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission7256/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0'),\n",

However, existing methods fall short in addressing potential conflicts and complex correlations between tasks, especially in parameter-level adjustments, posing a challenge in effectively balancing parameter competition across various tasks.

PCB-Merging employs intra-balancing to gauge parameter significance within individual tasks and inter-balancing to assess parameter similarities across different tasks. Parameters with low importance scores are dropped, and the remaining ones are rescaled to form the final merged model. We assessed our approach in diverse merging scenarios, including cross-task, cross-domain, and cross-training configurations, as well as out-of-domain generalization.

However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\\\\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\\\\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'reinforcement_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/0bcd516c1659debb7a9519921f2284981132e3b0.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nwang2024diffusion,\\ntitle={Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator},\\nauthor={Yinuo Wang and Likun Wang and Yuxuan Jiang and Wenjun Zou and Tong Liu and Xujie Song and Wenxuan Wang and Liming Xiao and Jiang WU and Jingliang Duan and Shengbo Eben Li},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=l0c1j4QvTq}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'wang|diffusion_actorcritic_with_entropy_regulator'}},forum = 'l0c1j4QvTq',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5884/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5884/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5884/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission5884/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY-NC-ND 4.0'),\n",

In this work, we propose Bayesian Model Reduction for Structured pruning (BMRS), a fully end-to-end Bayesian method of structured pruning. BMRS is based on two recent methods: Bayesian structured pruning with multiplicative noise, and Bayesian model reduction (BMR), a method which allows efficient comparison of Bayesian models under a change in prior. We present two realizations of BMRS derived from different priors which yield different structured pruning characteristics:  1) BMRS_N with the truncated log-normal prior, which offers reliable compression rates and accuracy without the need for tuning any thresholds and 2) BMRS_U with the truncated log-uniform prior that can achieve more aggressive compression based on the boundaries of truncation. Overall, we find that BMRS offers a theoretically grounded approach to structured pruning of neural networks yielding both high compression rates and accuracy.

However, the tension between the complexity of current alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment scenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach that can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce Aligner, a novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, Aligner can be directly applied to various open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it suitable for rapid iteration. Notably, Aligner can be applied to any powerful, large-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the upstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data, breaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements by deploying the same Aligner model across 11 different LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty).

However, the noisy and discrete nature of 3D Gaussian primitives hinders accurate surface estimation. Previous attempts to regularize 3D Gaussian normals often degrade rendering quality due to the fundamental disconnect between normal vectors and the rendering pipeline in 3DGS-based methods. Therefore, we introduce Normal-GS, a novel approach that integrates normal vectors into the 3DGS rendering pipeline. The core idea is to model the interaction between normals and incident lighting using the physically-based rendering equation. Our approach re-parameterizes surface colors as the product of normals and a designed Integrated Directional Illumination Vector (IDIV). To optimize memory usage and simplify optimization, we employ an anchor-based 3DGS to implicitly encode locally-shared IDIVs.

For the first time, we observe that GNNs benefit tremendously from the increasing scale of depth, width, number of molecules and associated labels. A major factor is the diversity of the pretraining data that comprises thousands of labels per molecule derived from bio-assays, quantum simulations, transcriptomics and phenomic imaging. We further demonstrate strong finetuning scaling behavior on 38 highly competitive downstream tasks, outclassing previous large models. This gives rise to MolGPS, a new graph foundation model that allows to navigate the chemical space, outperforming the previous state-of-the-arts on 26 out the 38 downstream tasks.

This paper introduces HydraViT, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by stacking attention heads to achieve a scalable ViT. By repeatedly changing the size of the embedded dimensions throughout each layer and their corresponding number of attention heads in MHA during training, HydraViT induces multiple subnetworks. Thereby, HydraViT achieves adaptability across a wide spectrum of hardware environments while maintaining performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of HydraViT in achieving a scalable ViT with up to 10 subnetworks, covering a wide range of resource constraints. HydraViT achieves up to 5 p.p. more accuracy with the same GMACs and up to 7 p.p. more accuracy with the same throughput on ImageNet-1K compared to the baselines, making it an effective solution for scenarios where hardware availability is diverse or varies over time.

Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL.

To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments.

We overcome these challenges thanks to three main insights: (i) synthetic pre-training with diverse enough data enables to learn reasonable characters localization in any script; (ii) modern transformer-based detectors can jointly detect a large number of instances and, if trained with an adequate masking strategy, leverage consistency between the different detections; (iii) once a pre-trained detection model with approximate character localization is available, it is possible to fine-tune it with line-level annotation on real data, even with a different alphabet.

However, these sequence-structure models have so far achieved only incremental improvements when compared to the leading sequence-only approaches, highlighting unresolved challenges effectively leveraging these modalities together. Moreover, the function of certain proteins is highly dependent on the granular aspects of their surface topology, which have been overlooked by prior models.\\nTo address these limitations, we introduce the Sequence-Structure-Surface Fitness (**S3F**) model — a novel multimodal representation learning framework that integrates protein features across several scales. Our approach combines sequence representations from a protein language model with Geometric Vector Perceptron networks encoding protein backbone and detailed surface topology. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art fitness prediction on the ProteinGym benchmark encompassing 217 substitution deep mutational scanning assays, and provides insights into the determinants of protein function.\\nOur code is at https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/S3F.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_learning_for_healthcare'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/42a9efb3a54368d5d17852708b09e753ae1f9ef0.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/229c096c8d5f97f10a461f44a15e6a3715d40575.zip'}, 'flagged_for_ethics_review': {'value': True}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nzhang2024multiscale,\\ntitle={Multi-Scale Representation Learning for Protein Fitness Prediction},\\nauthor={Zuobai Zhang and Pascal Notin and Yining Huang and Aurelie Lozano and Vijil Chenthamarakshan and Debora Susan Marks and Payel Das and Jian Tang},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=kWMVzIdCEn}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'zhang|multiscale_representation_learning_for_protein_fitness_prediction'}},forum = 'kWMVzIdCEn',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10830/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10830/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10830/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Ethics_Review_Flag', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission10830/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has demonstrated its superior performance in improving the robustness of small student models with the guidance of large teacher models. However, both AT and ARD encounter the robust fairness problem: these models exhibit strong robustness when facing part of classes (easy class), but weak robustness when facing others (hard class). In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of the potential factors and argue that the smoothness degree of samples' soft labels for different classes (i.e., hard class or easy class) will affect the robust fairness of DNNs from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above finding, we propose an Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) method to mitigate the adversarial robust fairness problem within the framework of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes to achieve fairness by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of samples' soft labels during the training process, and the smoothness degree of soft labels is controlled by assigning different temperatures in KD to different classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art AT, ARD, and robust fairness methods in the comprehensive metric (Normalized Standard Deviation) of robustness and fairness.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_vision'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/4778b077085c3a1b78c8e8796dd0c9ad4b693d64.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/25db253ede48e8e9d957ed7118a00214544864fc.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nzhao2024improving,\\ntitle={Improving Adversarial Robust Fairness via Anti-Bias Soft Label  Distillation},\\nauthor={Shiji Zhao and Ranjie Duan and xizhewang and Xingxing Wei},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=kW30LbNwdV}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'zhao|improving_adversarial_robust_fairness_via_antibias_soft_label_distillation'}},forum = 'kW30LbNwdV',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3800/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3800/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3800/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission3800/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Rather than uniformly applying predictions to all jobs, we propose a tailored approach that categorizes jobs to improve the effectiveness of prediction on performance. To achieve this, we employ one-bit “cheap predictions” to classify jobs as either short or long. SkipPredict prioritizes predicted short jobs over long jobs, and for the long jobs, SkipPredict applies a second round of more detailed “expensive predictions” to approximate Shortest Remaining Processing Time for these jobs. Importantly, our analyses take into account the cost of prediction. We derive closed-form formulas that calculate the mean response time of jobs with size predictions accounting for the prediction cost. We examine the effect of this cost for two distinct models in real-world and synthetic datasets.

VLPLs appear in crucial settings, including domain-specific languages for internal tools, tool-chains for legacy languages, and formal verification frameworks. Inspired by a technique called natural programming elicitation, we propose designing an intermediate language that LLMs ``naturally'' know how to use and which can be automatically compiled to a target VLPL. When LLMs generate code that lies outside of this intermediate language, we use compiler techniques to repair the code into programs in the intermediate language. Overall, we introduce _synthetic programming elicitation and compilation_ (SPEAC), an approach that enables LLMs to generate syntactically valid code even for VLPLs. We empirically evaluate the performance of SPEAC in a case study for the UCLID5 formal verification language and find that, compared to existing retrieval and fine-tuning baselines, SPEAC produces syntactically correct programs more frequently and without sacrificing semantic correctness.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'machine_learning_for_other_sciences_and_fields'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/e2adc0e0a86918c1285be23088831d2f1e432e58.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/4ee03c6902936a232b37e15b803ce88c0751d69c.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nmora2024synthetic,\\ntitle={Synthetic Programming Elicitation for Text-to-Code in Very Low-Resource Programming and Formal Languages},\\nauthor={Federico Mora and Justin Wong and Haley Lepe and Sahil Bhatia and Karim Elmaaroufi and George Varghese and Joseph E.

To ensure an effective and precise message passing from LLM to backend modules for function invocation, we propose a novel hybrid method by simultaneously integrating discrete textual instructions and continuous signal embeddings. Further, we design various pixel-level spatiotemporal vision-language alignment learning for Vitron to reach the best fine-grained visual capability. Finally, a cross-task synergy module is advised to learn to maximize the task-invariant fine-grained visual features, enhancing the synergy between different visual tasks.

While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples.\\nWe also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes.\\nOur results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts.

A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an estimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be shown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). However, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model mis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown to be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads. \\n\\nIn this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against semirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to ``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent with the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are allowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge appears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine the extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the input. \\n\\nOn the positive side, we identify a wide range of semirandom adversaries under which spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly consistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning. On the negative side, we show that in many of these settings, _normalized_ spectral bisection outputs a partitioning that makes a classification mistake on a constant fraction of the vertices. Finally, we demonstrate numerical experiments that complement our theoretical findings.\"}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'learning_theory'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/5a9d1312a2385c283f86a5a81131f54ed15f0605.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/0399ab625dad65f487cf574fec96aad101c9c293.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nbhaskara2024on,\\ntitle={On the Robustness of Spectral Algorithms for Semirandom Stochastic Block Models},\\nauthor={Aditya Bhaskara and Agastya Vibhuti Jha and Michael Kapralov and Naren Sarayu Manoj and Davide Mazzali and Weronika Wrzos-Kaminska},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=kLen1XyW6P}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'bhaskara|on_the_robustness_of_spectral_algorithms_for_semirandom_stochastic_block_models'}},forum = 'kLen1XyW6P',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19440/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19440/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19440/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19440/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

During diffusion training, current methods diffuse each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscibility phenomenon in physics, we propose *Immiscible Diffusion*, a simple and effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Thus, immiscibility means that the mixing of molecular sources is distinguishable. Inspired by this concept, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy to achieve *Immiscible Diffusion*. As one example, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to expel the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only *one line of code* to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. In this way, each image is preferably projected to nearby noise. To address the high complexity of the assignment algorithm, we employ a quantized assignment strategy, which significantly reduces the computational overhead to a negligible level (e.g. 22.8ms for a large batch size of 1024 on an A6000). Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve up to 3x faster training for unconditional Consistency Models on the CIFAR dataset, as well as for DDIM and Stable Diffusion on CelebA and ImageNet dataset, and in class-conditional training and fine-tuning. In addition, we conducted a thorough analysis that sheds light on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving fidelity.

The main focus of this paper is to explore the saturation effects for a large class of spectral algorithms (including the KRR, gradient descent, etc.) in large dimensional settings where $n \\\\asymp d^{\\\\gamma}$. More precisely, we first propose an improved minimax lower bound for the kernel regression problem in large dimensional settings and show that the gradient flow with early stopping strategy will result in an estimator achieving this lower bound (up to a logarithmic factor).

Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more robust and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator, and design diffusion rewards based on the classifier’s output for policy learning. Extensive experiments are conducted in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL’s effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more robust and smoother rewards.

Past researchers have proposed fast attention algorithms for LLMs by approximating or replace softmax attention with other functions, such as low-degree polynomials. The key property of these functions is that, when applied entry-wise to the matrix $QK^{\\\\top}$, the result is a low rank matrix when $Q$ and $K$ are $n \\\\times d$ matrices and $n \\\\gg d$. This suggests a natural question: what are all functions $f$ with this property? If other $f$ exist and are quickly computable, they can be used in place of softmax for fast subquadratic attention algorithms. It was previously known that low-degree polynomials have this property. We prove that low-degree polynomials are the only piecewise continuous functions with this property. This suggests that the low-rank fast attention only works for functions approximable by polynomials. Our work gives a converse to the polynomial method in algorithm design.\\n\\n2.

Besides, numerous studies have empirically shown that ACF can also improve recommendation performance compared to traditional CF. Despite these empirical successes, the theoretical understanding of ACF's effectiveness in terms of both performance and robustness remains unclear. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first theoretically show that ACF can achieve a lower recommendation error compared to traditional CF with the same training epochs in both clean and poisoned data contexts. Furthermore, by establishing bounds for reductions in recommendation error during ACF's optimization process, we find that applying personalized magnitudes of perturbation for different users based on their embedding scales can further improve ACF's effectiveness. Building on these theoretical understandings, we propose Personalized Magnitude Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (PamaCF).

First, they must determine the metric form and the underlying machine learning models for fitting nuisance parameters (e.g., outcome function, propensity function, and plug-in learner). Second, they lack a specific focus on selecting a robust CATE estimator. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Distributionally Robust Metric (DRM) for CATE estimator selection. The proposed DRM is nuisance-free, eliminating the need to fit models for nuisance parameters, and it effectively prioritizes the selection of a distributionally robust CATE estimator. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the DRM method in selecting CATE estimators that are robust to the distribution shift incurred by covariate shift and hidden confounders.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'causal_inference'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/1e73b68e1034ef4c885567c4e519ec3a06b8e2ee.pdf'}, 'supplementary_material': {'value': '/attachment/0c6112a4515039f4e353318941196115867a1891.zip'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nhuang2024unveiling,\\ntitle={Unveiling the Potential of Robustness in Selecting Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimators},\\nauthor={Yiyan HUANG and Cheuk Hang LEUNG and WANG Siyi and YIJUN LI and Qi WU},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=k4EP46Q9X2}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'huang|unveiling_the_potential_of_robustness_in_selecting_conditional_average_treatment_effect_estimators'}},forum = 'k4EP46Q9X2',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4584/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4584/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4584/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission4584/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

Previous work tackles this challenge by training on the source domain with modified rewards derived by matching distributions between the source and the target optimal trajectories. However, pure modified rewards only ensure the behavior of the learned policy in the source domain resembles trajectories produced by the target optimal policies, which does not guarantee optimal performance when the learned policy is actually deployed to the target domain. In this work, we propose to utilize imitation learning to transfer the policy learned from the reward modification to the target domain so that the new policy can generate the same trajectories in the target domain. Our approach, Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (DARAIL), utilizes the reward modification for domain adaptation and follows the general framework of generative adversarial imitation learning from observation (GAIfO) by applying a reward augmented estimator for the policy optimization step. Theoretically, we present an error bound for our method under a mild assumption regarding the dynamics shift to justify the motivation of our method. Empirically, our method outperforms the pure modified reward method without imitation learning and also outperforms other baselines in benchmark off-dynamics environments.'}, 'primary_area': {'value': 'reinforcement_learning'}, 'venue': {'value': 'NeurIPS 2024 poster'}, 'venueid': {'value': 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference'}, 'pdf': {'value': '/pdf/1c7da2697e981d7dc99700ecf2763a88cb4e7628.pdf'}, '_bibtex': {'value': '@inproceedings{\\nguo2024offdynamics,\\ntitle={Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning via Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation},\\nauthor={Yihong Guo and Yixuan Wang and Yuanyuan Shi and Pan Xu and Anqi Liu},\\nbooktitle={The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\\nyear={2024},\\nurl={https://openreview.net/forum?id=k2hS5Rt1N0}\\n}'}, 'paperhash': {'value': 'guo|offdynamics_reinforcement_learning_via_domain_adaptation_and_reward_augmented_imitation'}},forum = 'k2hS5Rt1N0',replyto = None,readers = ['everyone'],nonreaders = None,signatures = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19286/Authors'],writers = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19286/Authors'],details = None,invitations = ['NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Post_Submission', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19286/-/Revision', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/-/Edit', 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference/Submission19286/-/Camera_Ready_Revision'],domain = 'NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference',license = 'CC BY 4.0'),\n",

The visual geometry of a physical object in an image is determined by three orthogonal attributes: mechanical properties, external forces, and rest-shape geometry. Existing single-view 3D reconstruction methods often overlook this underlying composition, presuming rigidity or neglecting external forces. Consequently, the reconstructed objects fail to withstand real-world physical forces, resulting in instability or undesirable deformation -- diverging from their intended designs as depicted in the image. Our optimization framework addresses this by embedding physical compatibility into the reconstruction process. We explicitly decompose the three physical attributes and link them through static equilibrium, which serves as a hard constraint, ensuring that the optimized physical shapes exhibit desired physical behaviors. Evaluations on a dataset collected from Objaverse demonstrate that our framework consistently enhances the physical realism of 3D models over existing methods.

Traditional multi-label learning studies primarily focus on closed set scenario, i.e. the class label set of test data is identical to those used in training phase. Nevertheless, in numerous real-world scenarios, the environment is open and dynamic where unknown labels may emerge gradually during testing. In this paper, the problem of multi-label open set recognition (MLOSR) is investigated, which poses significant challenges in classifying and recognizing instances with unknown labels in multi-label setting. To enable open set multi-label prediction, a novel approach named SLAN is proposed by leveraging sub-labeling information enriched by structural information in the feature space. Accordingly, unknown labels are recognized by differentiating the sub-labeling information from holistic supervision.

We propose an approach that avoids the need for this stopping time by eschewing the use of schedules entirely, while exhibiting state-of-the-art performance compared to schedules across a wide family of problems ranging from convex problems to large-scale deep learning problems. Our Schedule-Free approach introduces no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum. Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging. An open source implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free.
